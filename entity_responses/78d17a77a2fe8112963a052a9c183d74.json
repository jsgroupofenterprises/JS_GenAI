  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe 'mon_install_child_signals' function is part of the OneWifi component in RDK and is responsible for installing signal handlers in a forked child process. These signal handlers are used to monitor the child process and take appropriate actions when certain signals are received.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n* The function begins by initializing the 'mon_counter_list' variable to NULL.\n* It then calls the 'mon_counter_reset' function to reset all the counters in the monitoring system.\n* Next, the function sets up signal handlers for SIGTERM, SIGINT, and SIGUSR1 signals. These signal handlers are defined in the 'mon_sig_crash', 'mon_sig_forward', and 'mon_sig_str' functions, respectively.\n* The signal handlers are installed using the 'signal' function, which takes the signal number and the signal handler as arguments.\n* After the signal handlers have been installed, the function returns.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe 'mon_install_child_signals' function interacts with the following other components:\n\n* The 'mon_sig_crash' function, which is the signal handler for SIGTERM and SIGINT signals.\n* The 'mon_sig_forward' function, which is the signal handler for SIGUSR1 signals.\n* The 'mon_sig_str' function, which is the signal handler for SIGUSR2 signals.\n* The 'mon_check_process' function, which checks if the child process is still alive.\n* The 'mon_check_counter' function, which checks if the child process has exceeded its allotted resource usage.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe 'mon_install_child_signals' function takes no parameters and returns no values.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe 'mon_install_child_signals' function uses the following RDK-specific functions:\n\n* The 'task_name_get' function is used to get the task name of the current process.\n* The 'task_name_set' function is used to set the task name of the current process.",
