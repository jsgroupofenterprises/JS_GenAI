  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\n   - The `wifi_getApSecurity` function is designed to retrieve the security settings of a specified wireless access point (AP) configured in the RDK system. It provides a way to obtain information about the security protocols, encryption algorithms, and authentication methods used by the AP.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n   - The function takes two parameters:\n     - `ap_index`: The index of the AP for which security information is being retrieved.\n     - `security`: A pointer to a `wifi_vap_security_t` structure that will be populated with the security settings of the AP.\n   - The function internally retrieves the security configuration from the RDK system and populates the `wifi_vap_security_t` structure with the following information:\n     - **Security mode**: Open, WEP, WPA, WPA2, or WPA3.\n     - **Encryption algorithm**: TKIP, AES, or CCMP.\n     - **Authentication method**: PSK, EAP, or RADIUS.\n   - The function returns an integer value indicating the status of the operation.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\n   - The function interacts with the RDK Wi-Fi Manager component to retrieve the security configuration of the specified AP.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n   - **Parameters**:\n     - `ap_index`: The index of the AP for which security information is being retrieved.\n     - `security`: A pointer to a `wifi_vap_security_t` structure that will be populated with the security settings of the AP.\n   - **Return values**:\n     - 0 on success.\n     - A negative value on failure.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\n   - The function is specific to the RDK platform and utilizes the RDK Wi-Fi Manager component to retrieve the security configuration of the AP.",
