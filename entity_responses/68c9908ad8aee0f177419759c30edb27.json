  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe WiFi Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP) is a protocol that allows for the easy and secure provisioning of Wi-Fi devices. DPP uses a combination of Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to provide a seamless and secure provisioning experience.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe DPP protocol consists of the following key operations:\n\n* **Device discovery:** DPP devices advertise their presence using BLE beacons.\n* **Key exchange:** DPP devices use a secure key exchange protocol to establish a shared secret.\n* **Configuration exchange:** DPP devices exchange configuration information, such as SSID and passphrase.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nDPP interacts with the following other components:\n\n* **Wi-Fi driver:** The Wi-Fi driver provides the necessary hardware support for DPP.\n* **BLE driver:** The BLE driver provides the necessary hardware support for DPP.\n* **Network manager:** The network manager manages the Wi-Fi connection and provides the necessary configuration information for DPP.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following are the most important parameters and return values for the DPP API:\n\n* **wifi_dpp_config_t:** This structure contains the DPP configuration.\n* **wifi_dpp_event_t:** This structure contains the DPP event.\n* **RETURN_OK:** This return value indicates that the operation was successful.\n* **RETURN_ERR:** This return value indicates that the operation failed.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe RDK-specific DPP operations are as follows:\n\n* **wifi_dpp_set_config:** This function sets the DPP configuration.\n* **wifi_dpp_enable:** This function enables DPP.\n* **wifi_dpp_disable:** This function disables DPP.\n* **wifi_dpp_event_callback:** This function registers a callback for DPP events.\n\n**Additional information**\n\nThe DPP protocol is defined in the following specification:\n\n* [Wi-Fi Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP)](https://www.wi-fi.org/specifications/dpp)\n\nThe DPP API is defined in the following header file:\n\n* `wifi_dpp.h`",
