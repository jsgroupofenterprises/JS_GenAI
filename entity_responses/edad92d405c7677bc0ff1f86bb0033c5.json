  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\n* The `wifi_getApAssociatedDevicesHighWatermarkThreshold` function is used to get the HighWatermarkThreshold value for an Access Point (AP).\n* The HighWatermarkThreshold is a value that is less than or equal to the MaxAssociatedDevices value for the AP.\n* When the number of associated devices reaches the HighWatermarkThreshold, the AP will start to track the number of times this threshold has been reached.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n* The function takes two parameters:\n    * `apIndex`: The index of the AP for which to get the HighWatermarkThreshold.\n    * `output`: A pointer to a variable in which to store the HighWatermarkThreshold value.\n* The function will return the HighWatermarkThreshold value for the specified AP.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\n* This function interacts with the WiFi driver to get the HighWatermarkThreshold value for the specified AP.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n* `apIndex`: The index of the AP for which to get the HighWatermarkThreshold.\n* `output`: A pointer to a variable in which to store the HighWatermarkThreshold value.\n* The function will return one of the following values:\n    * `RETURN_OK`: The function was successful.\n    * `RETURN_ERR`: The function failed.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\n* This function is not specific to RDK.",
