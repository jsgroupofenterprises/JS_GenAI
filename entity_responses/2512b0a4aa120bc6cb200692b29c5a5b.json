  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**:\n   - The main purpose of the `handle_read` function is to handle the reception of data from a network interface.\n   - It is part of the CcspWifiAgent component, which is responsible for managing Wi-Fi connections and related operations.\n   - When data is received on a Wi-Fi interface, this function is called to process the data.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n   - The function takes the following parameters:\n     - `ctx`: A pointer to a driver data structure.\n     - `src_addr`: The source MAC address of the received data.\n     - `buf`: A pointer to the received data buffer.\n     - `len`: The length of the received data.\n   - The function processes the received data by passing it to the `eapol_rx()` function, which is responsible for handling EAPOL (Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN) frames.\n   - The `eapol_rx()` function processes the EAPOL frames and performs the necessary actions, such as authenticating the client or negotiating encryption keys.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**:\n   - The `handle_read` function interacts with the following components:\n     - The Wi-Fi driver, which receives data from the network interface.\n     - The EAPOL module, which processes EAPOL frames.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n   - **Parameters**:\n     - `ctx`: The pointer to the driver data structure is an important parameter as it contains information about the Wi-Fi interface that received the data.\n     - `src_addr`: The source MAC address of the received data is important for identifying the sender of the data.\n     - `buf`: The pointer to the received data buffer is important as it contains the actual data received from the network.\n     - `len`: The length of the received data is important as it indicates the amount of data that was received.\n   - **Return values**:\n     - The function has no return value.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**:\n   - The function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
