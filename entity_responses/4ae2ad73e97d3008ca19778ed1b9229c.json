  "response": "## 1. Main purpose and functionality\n\nThe `voice_hal_getLineEnable` function retrieves the line enable status which indicates whether the specified line is enabled or not. This status affects the availability of the phone line for making or receiving calls.\n\n\n## 2. Key operations and data flow\n\nThe function takes four arguments:\n\n- `service`: The voice service for which the line enable status is to be retrieved.\n- `profile`: The voice profile for which the line enable status is to be retrieved.\n- `line`: The line number for which the line enable status is to be retrieved.\n- `peLineEnable`: A pointer to a `VoiceHalLineEnable_e` enum variable that will receive the line enable status.\n\nThe function returns an integer status code indicating the success or failure of the operation. If the operation is successful, the `peLineEnable` variable will be set to one of the following values:\n\n- `VOICE_HAL_LINE_ENABLE_ON`: The line is enabled.\n- `VOICE_HAL_LINE_ENABLE_OFF`: The line is disabled.\n\n## 3. Interaction with other components (if any)\n\nThe `voice_hal_getLineEnable` function interacts with the following other components:\n\n- The Voice HAL driver, which provides the actual implementation of the line enable functionality.\n- The Voice HAL API, which provides a higher-level interface to the Voice HAL driver.\n\n## 4. Important parameters and return values\n\nThe following parameters and return values are important to note:\n\n- `service`: The voice service for which the line enable status is to be retrieved. This parameter must be one of the following values:\n  - `VOICE_HAL_SERVICE_SIP`\n  - `VOICE_HAL_SERVICE_H323`\n- `profile`: The voice profile for which the line enable status is to be retrieved. This parameter must be a valid profile index.\n- `line`: The line number for which the line enable status is to be retrieved. This parameter must be a valid line number for the specified profile.\n- `peLineEnable`: A pointer to a `VoiceHalLineEnable_e` enum variable that will receive the line enable status.\n- Return value: The function returns an integer status code indicating the success or failure of the operation. If the operation is successful, the return value will be `RDK_SUCCESS`. Otherwise, the return value will be a negative error code.\n\n## 5. Any specific RDK-related operations\n\nThe `voice_hal_getLineEnable` function is a specific RDK-related operation. It is used to retrieve the line enable status for a specified voice service, profile, and line.",
