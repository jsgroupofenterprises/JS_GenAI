Main purpose and functionality\n\nThe ovsdb_table_delete_where function in CcspWifiAgent is responsible for deleting rows from a specified Open vSwitch Database (OVSDB) table that match a given JSON-formatted where clause.\n\n### 2. Key operations and data flow\n\n- The function takes three parameters:\n  - `ovsdb_sock_path`: The path to the OVSDB socket file.\n  - `table`: A pointer to the OVSDB table from which rows should be deleted.\n  - `where`: A JSON object representing the where clause.\n- The function calls the ovsdb_sync_delete_where function with the provided parameters.\n- ovsdb_sync_delete_where establishes a connection to the OVSDB server using the specified socket path and sends a delete request with the specified where clause.\n- If the delete operation is successful, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns a negative error code.\n\n### 3. Interaction with other components\n\nThe ovsdb_table_delete_where function interacts with the following components:\n- **OVSDB server**: The function communicates with the OVSDB server to perform the delete operation.\n- **CcspWifiAgent**: The function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component, which is responsible for managing Wi-Fi connections.\n\n### 4. Important parameters and return values\n\n- **ovsdb_sock_path**: The path to the OVSDB socket file. This is typically specified in the /etc/ovsdb/ovsdb.conf configuration file.\n- **table**: A pointer to the OVSDB table from which rows should be deleted.\n- **where**: A JSON object representing the where clause. The where clause specifies the conditions that must be met for rows to be deleted.\n- **Return value**: The function returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure.\n\n### 5. Any specific RDK-related operations\n\nThe ovsdb_table_delete_where function is part of the RDK (Reference Design Kit) for cable modems and set-top boxes. The RDK provides a common platform for developing and deploying home gateway software applications.",
