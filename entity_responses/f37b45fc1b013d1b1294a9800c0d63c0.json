Main purpose and functionality\n\nThe `wifi_received8021xFrame_callback` is a callback function used to register a callback to be invoked when an 802.1x frame is received by the Wi-Fi HAL. This callback provides information about the received 802.1x frame, including the AP index, STA MAC address, EAPOL type, data, and length.\n\n### 2. Key operations and data flow\n\nThe `wifi_received8021xFrame_callback` is typically registered using the `wifi_mgmt_frame_callbacks_register` function. When an 802.1x frame is received by the Wi-Fi HAL, the callback function is invoked with the following parameters:\n\n- `unsigned int ap_index`: The index of the AP that received the frame.\n- `mac_address_t sta`: The MAC address of the STA that sent the frame.\n- `wifi_eapol_type_t type`: The EAPOL type of the frame.\n- `void *data`: A pointer to the data portion of the frame.\n- `unsigned int len`: The length of the data portion of the frame.\n\n### 3. Interaction with other components (if any)\n\nThe `wifi_received8021xFrame_callback` interacts with the Wi-Fi HAL to receive 802.1x frames.\n\n### 4. Important parameters and return values\n\nThe following are important parameters and return values of the `wifi_received8021xFrame_callback`:\n\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `unsigned int ap_index`: The index of the AP that received the frame.\n  - `mac_address_t sta`: The MAC address of the STA that sent the frame.\n  - `wifi_eapol_type_t type`: The EAPOL type of the frame.\n  - `void *data`: A pointer to the data portion of the frame.\n  - `unsigned int len`: The length of the data portion of the frame.\n- **Return values**: None\n\n### 5. Any specific RDK-related operations\n\nThe `wifi_received8021xFrame_callback` is not specific to RDK.",
