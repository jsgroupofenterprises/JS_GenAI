  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `wifi_setBandSteeringEnable` function is part of the RDK HAL component and is used to enable or disable band steering on a Wi-Fi network. Band steering is a feature that automatically steers clients to the optimal Wi-Fi band (2.4 GHz or 5 GHz) based on factors such as signal strength, data rate, and congestion.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes a single parameter, `enable`, which is a boolean value that specifies whether to enable (TRUE) or disable (FALSE) band steering. When band steering is enabled, the RDK HAL will automatically steer clients to the optimal Wi-Fi band based on the factors mentioned above. When band steering is disabled, clients will be able to connect to either the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz band manually.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `wifi_setBandSteeringEnable` function interacts with the RDK Wi-Fi driver to enable or disable band steering. The Wi-Fi driver is responsible for managing the Wi-Fi network and implementing the band steering algorithm.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n|---|---|\n| `enable` | Boolean value that specifies whether to enable (TRUE) or disable (FALSE) band steering |\n| Return value | The status of the operation. RETURN_OK if successful, RETURN_ERR otherwise |\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `wifi_setBandSteeringEnable` function is a RDK-specific function that is not part of the standard Wi-Fi API. It is used to control the band steering feature on RDK-based Wi-Fi devices.",
