  "response": "**Analysis of ethernet_port_details Structure**\n\n**1. Purpose:**\n* Represents details of an Ethernet port.\n\n**2. Key Fields:**\n* **Name (char[64]):** Unique name of the Ethernet port.\n* **Mac (UCHAR[6]):** MAC address associated with the port.\n\n**3. Usage Context in RDK:**\n* Used in HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) to provide information about Ethernet ports to higher-level components.\n* Allows other components (e.g., network management) to identify and manage Ethernet ports.\n\n**4. Related Components or Interfaces:**\n* Networking drivers and management interfaces that handle Ethernet port operations.\n\n**5. Specific RDK-Related Details:**\n* Follows the RDK HAL API conventions for data structures.\n* May be used in RDK software components that require information about Ethernet ports, such as:\n    * Broadband Network Gateway (BNG)\n    * Data Plane Unit (DPU)\n* Can be extended or customized by SoC (System-on-Chip) vendors to provide additional information or features specific to their hardware.",
