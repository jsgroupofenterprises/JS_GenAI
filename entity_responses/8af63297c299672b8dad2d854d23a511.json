  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality:**\n    - The `wifi_getDownStreamGroupAddress` function retrieves information about the downstream group address for a specified access point (AP).\n\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow:**\n    - The function takes two parameters:\n        - `apIndex`: Specifies the index of the AP for which the downstream group address is to be retrieved.\n        - `disabled`: A pointer to a boolean variable that will be set to indicate whether the downstream group address is disabled or not.\n    - The function retrieves the downstream group address and sets the `disabled` variable accordingly.\n\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any):**\n    - The function interacts with the HAL to retrieve the downstream group address information.\n\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values:**\n    - `apIndex`: Specifies the index of the AP for which the downstream group address is to be retrieved.\n    - `disabled`: A pointer to a boolean variable that will be set to indicate whether the downstream group address is disabled or not.\n    - The function returns the status of the operation as an integer, which can be one of the following values:\n        - `RETURN_OK` if the operation was successful.\n        - `RETURN_ERR` if any error was encountered.\n\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n    - The function does not perform any RDK-specific operations.",
