  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\n    - The `wifi_enableCSIEngine` function is part of the RDK HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) for Wi-Fi.\n    - It allows the caller to enable or disable the Capability Set Information (CSI) Engine for a specific station (STA) on a specific Access Point (AP).\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n    - The function takes several parameters:\n        - `apIndex`: The index of the AP on which the CSI Engine should be enabled or disabled.\n        - `sta`: The MAC address of the STA for which the CSI Engine should be enabled or disabled.\n        - `enable`: A boolean value indicating whether to enable (`TRUE`) or disable (`FALSE`) the CSI Engine.\n    - The function calls the underlying hardware driver to perform the requested operation.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components:**\n\n    - The `wifi_enableCSIEngine` function interacts with the Wi-Fi hardware driver to enable or disable the CSI Engine.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n    - **Parameters**:\n        - `apIndex`: The index of the AP on which the CSI Engine should be enabled or disabled.\n        - `sta`: The MAC address of the STA for which the CSI Engine should be enabled or disabled.\n        - `enable`: A boolean value indicating whether to enable (`TRUE`) or disable (`FALSE`) the CSI Engine.\n    - **Return value**:\n        - The function returns an integer value indicating the status of the operation:\n            - `0` if the operation was successful.\n            - A negative value if the operation failed.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\n    - The `wifi_enableCSIEngine` function is part of the RDK HAL for Wi-Fi and is specifically designed for use with RDK-based Wi-Fi devices.",
