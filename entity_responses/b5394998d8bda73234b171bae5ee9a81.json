  "response": "**Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe Wi-Fi DPP (Device Provisioning Protocol) HAL API provides a set of functions for the implementation of the DPP protocol in a Wi-Fi Access Point (AP). The DPP protocol allows devices to securely provision Wi-Fi credentials without the need for manual configuration or user interaction.\n\n**Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe Wi-Fi DPP HAL API provides the following key operations:\n\n* **Initialize DPP:** Initializes the DPP protocol on the AP.\n* **Start DPP:** Starts the DPP process on the AP.\n* **Stop DPP:** Stops the DPP process on the AP.\n* **Get DPP configuration:** Gets the current DPP configuration on the AP.\n* **Set DPP configuration:** Sets the DPP configuration on the AP.\n* **Get DPP status:** Gets the current DPP status on the AP.\n* **Add DPP peer:** Adds a DPP peer to the AP.\n* **Remove DPP peer:** Removes a DPP peer from the AP.\n* **Get DPP peers:** Gets a list of the DPP peers on the AP.\n* **Process DPP message:** Processes a DPP message received from a peer.\n* **Send DPP message:** Sends a DPP message to a peer.\n\n**Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe Wi-Fi DPP HAL API interacts with the following components:\n\n* **Wi-Fi network management:** The Wi-Fi network management component is responsible for managing the Wi-Fi network on the AP. The DPP HAL API provides the Wi-Fi network management component with the necessary information to provision Wi-Fi credentials to devices.\n* **Security:** The security component is responsible for securing the Wi-Fi network. The DPP HAL API provides the security component with the necessary information to secure the Wi-Fi credentials that are provisioned to devices.\n\n**Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following parameters are important to the Wi-Fi DPP HAL API:\n\n* **DPP configuration:** The DPP configuration contains the settings that control the operation of the DPP protocol on the AP.\n* **DPP status:** The DPP status contains information about the current state of the DPP protocol on the AP.\n* **DPP peer:** A DPP peer is a device that is participating in the DPP protocol with the AP.\n\nThe following return values are important to the Wi-Fi DPP HAL API:\n\n* **RETURN_OK:** The operation was successful.\n* **RETURN_ERR:** The operation failed.\n\n**Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe Wi-Fi DPP HAL API does not have any specific RDK-related operations.",
