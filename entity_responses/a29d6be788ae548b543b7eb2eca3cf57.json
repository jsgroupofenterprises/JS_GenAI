Main purpose and Functionality\n  - The `wifi_apDisassociatedDevice_callback_register` function registers a callback function that will be invoked when a client device is disassociated from the Wi-Fi access point (AP).\n\n### 2. Key operations and data flow\n  - The function takes a callback function as an argument.\n  - It stores the callback function in the `g_simulator.cb[wifi_hal_cb_disconnect].func` variable.\n  - When a client device is disassociated from the AP, the stored callback function will be invoked.\n\n### 3. Interaction with other components\n  - This function interacts with the simulator component, which is responsible for managing the simulated Wi-Fi AP.\n\n### 4. Important parameters and return values\n  - input:\n    - `device_disassociated` : Callback function to be registered.\n  - output:\n    - None\n\n### 5.
