  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**: The `hash_map_put` function is responsible for inserting a new key-value pair into a hash map data structure. The hash map is implemented using a queue data structure, where each element in the queue represents a key-value pair. The function allocates memory for a new element, fills in the key and data fields from the provided arguments, and then inserts the element into the queue.\n2. **Key operations and data flow**: The key operations performed by the function are memory allocation for the new element and insertion of the element into the queue. The data flow involves copying the provided key and data into the new element and then adding the element to the tail of the queue.\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**: The function interacts with the queue data structure to insert the new element. The queue is implemented separately and is assumed to be accessible by the function.\n4. **Important parameters and return values**: The important parameters are the hash map pointer (`map`), the key (`key`), and the data (`data`). The return value is an integer indicating success or failure (-1 for failure, 0 for success).\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**: There are no specific RDK-related operations performed by this function. The function implements a generic hash map insertion operation that can be used in any RDK component.",
