  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\n* The `ovsdb_table_select_where` function is used to query an OVSDB table based on a specified WHERE condition.\n* It retrieves records from the OVSDB table that satisfy the given condition.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n* The function takes several parameters, including the OVSDB socket path, the OVSDB table to query, a JSON representation of the WHERE condition, and a pointer to an integer variable to store the number of matching records.\n* It first uses the `ovsdb_sync_select_where` function to execute the WHERE query and retrieve the matching rows from the OVSDB table.\n* If any matching rows are found, the function allocates memory to store the corresponding records.\n* It then iterates through the matching rows, converting each row from JSON to the specified OVSDB table schema.\n* The function returns a pointer to the array of records that satisfy the WHERE condition.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\n* The function interacts with the OVSDB server through the OVSDB socket path.\n* It also interacts with the OVSDB schema to convert JSON rows to OVSDB table records.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n* **Parameters:**\n    * `ovsdb_sock_path`: The path to the OVSDB socket.\n    * `table`: A pointer to the OVSDB table to query.\n    * `where`: A JSON representation of the WHERE condition.\n    * `count`: A pointer to an integer variable to store the number of matching records.\n* **Return value:** A pointer to an array of records that satisfy the WHERE condition, or `NULL` if no matching records are found or an error occurs.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\n* The function uses RDK-specific functions such as `ovsdb_sync_select_where` and `ovsdb_table_from_json`.",
