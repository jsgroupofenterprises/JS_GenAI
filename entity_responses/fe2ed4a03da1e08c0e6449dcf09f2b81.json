  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe CcspHalEthSwGetEthPortStats function in the RDK HAL component retrieves Ethernet port statistics for the specified port.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n* PortId: The ID of the Ethernet port to retrieve statistics for.\n* pStats: A pointer to a CCSP_HAL_ETH_STATS structure to receive the port statistics.\n\nThe function retrieves the port statistics from the underlying hardware and populates the CCSP_HAL_ETH_STATS structure with the following information:\n\n* RxBytes: The number of bytes received on the port.\n* RxPackets: The number of packets received on the port.\n* RxErrors: The number of errors encountered while receiving packets on the port.\n* TxBytes: The number of bytes transmitted on the port.\n* TxPackets: The number of packets transmitted on the port.\n* TxErrors: The number of errors encountered while transmitting packets on the port.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThis function interacts with the underlying hardware to retrieve the Ethernet port statistics.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* PortId: The ID of the Ethernet port to retrieve statistics for.\n* pStats: A pointer to a CCSP_HAL_ETH_STATS structure to receive the port statistics.\n\nThe function returns INT to indicate the status of the operation. A value of 0 indicates success, while a negative value indicates an error.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThis function is part of the RDK HAL component, which provides a common interface for accessing hardware functionality across different RDK platforms.",
