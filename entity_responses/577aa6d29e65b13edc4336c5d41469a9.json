  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality:**\n\n   The `auth_frame_sent` function handles the reception of an authentication frame from a wireless station (STA) to an access point (AP). It creates a `wifi_auth_data_t` structure to hold the authentication data received, and then pushes it to the data plane queue for further processing.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow:**\n\n   a. Allocates memory for a `wifi_auth_data_t` structure and initializes it.\n   b. Allocates memory for the authentication data and copies it from the `data` parameter.\n   c. Sets the `vap` (virtual AP) index and copies the STA's MAC address into the structure.\n   d. Sets the direction of the authentication frame to downlink (from AP to STA).\n   e. Creates a data plane packet using the `data_plane_queue_create_packet` function and pushes it to the data plane queue.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components:**\n\n   - The `data_plane_queue_push` function is part of the Wi-Fi Data Plane module in RDK.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values:**\n\n   - `ap_index`: The index of the AP that received the authentication frame.\n   - `sta`: The MAC address of the STA that sent the authentication frame.\n   - `data`: A pointer to the authentication data received.\n   - `len`: The length of the authentication data.\n\n5. **Specific RDK-related operations:**\n\n   - The `data_plane_queue_create_packet` and `data_plane_queue_push` functions are part of the RDK Wi-Fi Data Plane module, which is responsible for handling the transmission and reception of data packets between the AP and STAs.",
