  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**\n\n   The `ActiveMeasurements_Plan_Rollback` function is responsible for rolling back the active measurement plan that was previously set.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**\n\n   The function first retrieves the pointer to the `COSA_DATAMODEL_WIFI` object and the pointer to the `COSA_DML_WIFI_HARVESTER` object.\n   It then checks if the boolean flag `bActiveMsmtPlanIDChanged` is set to true, indicating that the active measurement plan ID has changed.\n   If the flag is set to true, the function resets the flag to false, effectively rolling back the active measurement plan.\n   The function returns 0 if the rollback is successful.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\n   The function interacts with the `COSA_DATAMODEL_WIFI` object and the `COSA_DML_WIFI_HARVESTER` object.\n   It does not interact with any other components.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**\n\n   The function takes one parameter:\n\n   - `hInsContext`: The instance handle of the WiFi object.\n\n   The function returns a ULONG value of 0 if the rollback is successful.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\n   The function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
