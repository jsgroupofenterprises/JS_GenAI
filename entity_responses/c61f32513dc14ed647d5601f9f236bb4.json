  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**:\n    - The `os_nif_gateway_set` function is responsible for setting the default gateway for a given network interface. \n    - It modifies the routing table by adding a default route via the specified gateway address.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n    - The function takes two parameters: `ifname` (the name of the network interface) and `gwaddr` (the gateway address to be set). \n    - It constructs an `iproute` command that adds a default route via the specified gateway address and interface, and executes the command using `system()`.\n    - If the command execution is successful (returns 0), it indicates that the gateway was successfully set, and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components**:\n    - The function does not directly interact with other components, but it relies on the `ip` command-line utility to modify the routing table.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n    - `ifname`: The name of the network interface for which the gateway is to be set.\n    - `gwaddr`: The gateway address to be set.\n    - Return value: `true` if the gateway was successfully set, `false` otherwise.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**:\n    - The function does not perform any RDK-specific operations.",
