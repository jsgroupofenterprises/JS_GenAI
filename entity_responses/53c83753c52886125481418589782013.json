  "response": "## 1. Main purpose and functionality ##\n\n- The `process_packet` function in the CcspWiFiAgent component is designed to handle and process different types of data plane packets received from the Wi-Fi module. \n- It plays a crucial role in managing data plane communication and providing access to the network for connected devices. \n\n\n## 2. Key operations and data flow ##\n\n- The function takes two primary parameters: \n> - `wifi_data_plane_packet_t *packet`: Represents the received data plane packet that needs to be processed. \n> - `wifi_data_plane_t *module`: Provides access to the Wi-Fi data plane module, which manages the Wi-Fi network configuration and state information.\n\n- Based on the type of the received packet, the function delegates the processing to specialized sub-functions: \n> - For EAPOL (802.1X) packets, it invokes `process_8021x_packet` to perform EAPOL-related operations. \n> - For authentication packets, it calls `process_auth_packet` to handle authentication-related tasks. \n> - For association request packets, it invokes `process_assoc_req_packet` to process association requests from devices. \n> - For association response packets, it calls `process_assoc_rsp_packet` to handle association responses received from the access point.\n\n\n## 3. Interaction with other components ##\n\n- The `process_packet` function interacts closely with the Wi-Fi data plane module (`wifi_data_plane_t *module`) to access its sub-modules responsible for handling specific packet types.\n\n\n## 4. Important parameters and return values ##\n\n- **Input parameters:** \n> - `wifi_data_plane_packet_t *packet`: Represents the received data plane packet that needs to be processed. \n> - `wifi_data_plane_t *module`: Provides access to the Wi-Fi data plane module, which manages the Wi-Fi network configuration and state information.\n\n- **Return value:** \n> - The function has a `void` return type, indicating that it does not return any specific value. Instead, it performs its operations and returns control to the caller.\n\n\n## 5. Any specific RDK-related operations ##\n\n- The `process_packet` function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component, which is part of the RDK Broadband Stack and is responsible for managing the Wi-Fi data plane.",
