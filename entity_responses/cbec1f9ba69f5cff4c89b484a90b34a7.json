  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `INT wifi_receivedDataFrame_callback` function is a callback function that is registered with the HAL to receive data frames from the network. When a data frame is received, the HAL will call the callback function with the following parameters:\n\n* `apIndex` - The index of the AP that received the frame.\n* `sta_mac` - The MAC address of the station that sent the frame.\n* `frame` - A pointer to the data frame.\n* `len` - The length of the data frame.\n* `type` - The type of data frame.\n* `dir` - The direction of the data frame.\n\nThe callback function can then process the data frame as needed.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow:**\n\nThe key operations and data flow of the `INT wifi_receivedDataFrame_callback` function are as follows:\n\n1. The HAL receives a data frame from the network.\n2. The HAL calls the `wifi_receivedDataFrame_callback` function with the parameters listed above.\n3. The callback function processes the data frame as needed.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThe `INT wifi_receivedDataFrame_callback` function does not interact with any other components directly. However, it may indirectly interact with other components such as the network stack or the application layer.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values:**\n\nThe important parameters and return values of the `INT wifi_receivedDataFrame_callback` function are as follows:\n\n* `apIndex` - The index of the AP that received the frame.\n* `sta_mac` - The MAC address of the station that sent the frame.\n* `frame` - A pointer to the data frame.\n* `len` - The length of the data frame.\n* `type` - The type of data frame.\n* `dir` - The direction of the data frame.\n* `INT` - The return value of the callback function.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThe `INT wifi_receivedDataFrame_callback` function is not specific to RDK.",
