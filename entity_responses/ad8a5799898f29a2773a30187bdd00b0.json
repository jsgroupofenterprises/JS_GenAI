  "response": "### 1. Main purpose and functionality\n    - Voice_hal_getDigitMap function retrieves a null-terminated list of permissible digits for normal or emergency use in a specific region.\n    - This function is useful for configuring the ATA (Analog Telephone Adapter) to allow or restrict certain digits based on the region's regulations.\n### 2. Key operations and data flow\n    - The function takes five parameters:\n        - Service: Specifies the voice service (e.g., SIP, MGCP).\n        - Profile: Specifies the voice profile associated with the line.\n        - Map Type: Indicates whether the digit map is for normal or emergency use.\n        - Digit Map String: A pointer to a character array that will store the retrieved digit map string.\n        - Buffer Length: A pointer to an integer that specifies the size of the digit map string buffer.\n    - The function retrieves the digit map string from the voice service and stores it in the provided buffer.\n    - If the buffer is too small to hold the entire digit map string, the function returns an error.\n### 3. Interaction with other components (if any)\n    - This function interacts with the voice service component to retrieve the digit map string.\n### 4. Important parameters and return values\n    - **service**: Specifies the voice service that is being queried for the digit map.\n    - **profile**: Specifies the voice profile that is associated with the line for which the digit map is being retrieved.\n    - **map_type**: Specifies whether the digit map is for normal or emergency use.\n    - **digit_map_string**: A pointer to a character array that will store the retrieved digit map string.\n    - **uiBufLen**: A pointer to an integer that specifies the size of the digit map string buffer.\n    - **Return value**: The function returns RDK_SUCCESS if successful, or RDK_FAILURE if any error occurs.\n### 5. Any specific RDK-related operations\n    - This function is part of the RDK Voice HAL API, which provides a set of interfaces for controlling voice services on RDK-based devices.",
