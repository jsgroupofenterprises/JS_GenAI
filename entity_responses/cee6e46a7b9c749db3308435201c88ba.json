  "response": "## Analysis of mon_sig_str Function\n\n### 1. Main Purpose and Functionality\n\nThe `mon_sig_str` function translates a signal number (`signum`) into a human-readable string (`sigstr`). This allows developers to easily handle and understand different types of signals in their code.\n\n### 2. Key Operations and Data Flow\n\n- The function takes three parameters: `signum` (the signal number), `sigstr` (a buffer to store the signal string), and `sigstr_sz` (the size of the `sigstr` buffer).\n- It initializes two character arrays: `sig_default` and `sig`.\n- The function then enters a `switch` statement based on the value of `signum`. Each case translates a specific signal number into a corresponding signal string (`sig`).\n- If the `signum` does not match any of the defined cases, it uses `snprintf` to create a default signal string using the `signum` value.\n- Finally, it combines the signal name (`sig`) and its canonical string representation from `strsignal` into `sigstr` using `snprintf`.\n\n### 3. Interaction with Other Components\n\nThis function primarily interacts with the `strsignal` library function, which provides canonical string representations of signals. It does not have direct interactions with other RDK components.\n\n### 4. Important Parameters and Return Values\n\n- `signum`: The signal number to convert into a string.\n- `sigstr`: A buffer to store the resulting signal string.\n- `sigstr_sz`: The size of the `sigstr` buffer, ensuring it can hold the translated signal string.\n- The function returns `void`.\n\n### 5. RDK-Related Operations\n\nThis function is not specific to RDK and can be used in any C program that handles signals.",
