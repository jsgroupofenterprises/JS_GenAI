  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `wifi_setFTResourceRequestSupported` function sets whether to support the Fast Transition (FT) Resource Request frame for the specified access point (AP). FT is a mechanism that allows a client device to roam between APs without having to re-authenticate with the network.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n- `apIndex`: The index of the AP to set the FT Resource Request support for.\n- `supported`: A pointer to a boolean value that indicates whether to support FT Resource Request frames.\n\nThe function sets the specified value in the FT configuration for the specified AP.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `wifi_setFTResourceRequestSupported` function interacts with the following components:\n\n- The Wi-Fi driver: The function sends the FT configuration to the Wi-Fi driver, which then applies the configuration to the AP.\n- The network management system (NMS): The NMS can use the `wifi_setFTResourceRequestSupported` function to configure FT support for APs in the network.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following parameters and return values are important for the `wifi_setFTResourceRequestSupported` function:\n\n- `apIndex`: The index of the AP to set the FT Resource Request support for.\n- `supported`: A pointer to a boolean value that indicates whether to support FT Resource Request frames.\n- Return value: The function returns `RETURN_OK` if the operation was successful, or `RETURN_ERR` if an error occurred.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `wifi_setFTResourceRequestSupported` function is not specific to RDK. However, RDK provides a number of tools and utilities that can be used to manage FT support in a network. For example, the RDK Network Configuration Utility (NCU) can be used to configure FT support for APs in the network.",
