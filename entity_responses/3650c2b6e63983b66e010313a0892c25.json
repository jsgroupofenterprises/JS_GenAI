  "response": "## Function Analysis: mon_sig_forward\n\n### 1. Main Purpose and Functionality\n`mon_sig_forward` forwards a signal to a specified process ID (`mon_sig_forward_pid`) within the OneWifi component of RDK.\n\n### 2. Key Operations and Data Flow\n- Checks if a valid `mon_sig_forward_pid` is set.\n- Converts the `signum` (signal number) to a string representation stored in `sigstr`.\n- Logs the event of forwarding the signal to the specified process.\n- Uses the `kill` function to send the signal to the process.\n- If the `kill` operation fails, it logs an error message and clears the `mon_sig_forward_pid` value.\n\n### 3. Interaction with Other Components\nThis function is intended to be used within the OneWifi component of RDK. It does not interact directly with other components.\n\n### 4. Important Parameters and Return Values\n- **Parameters:**\n  - `signum`: The signal number to be forwarded.\n- **Return Value:**\n  - None; the function is `void`.\n\n### 5. Specific RDK-related Operations\nThis function uses the `LOG` macro to log messages, which is commonly used in RDK-based software.",
