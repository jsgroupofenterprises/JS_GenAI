  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe purpose of the `ovsdb_tran_insert_with_parent` function is to perform a two-step database transaction using OVSDB (Open vSwitch Database) for inserting a row into a table with a parent-child relationship. It first inserts a row into a child table with a named UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) and then updates the parent table to include the child's UUID.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n- **First transaction:**\n  - Creates a JSON object with a named UUID called \"child_id\".\n  - Performs an insert operation on the specified child table using OVSDB's multi-transaction API, using the created JSON object as the initial transaction object and providing the table name, operation type (insert), where clause (null), and row to insert.\n\n- **Second transaction:**\n  - Creates a JSON array with the parent column name and an insert operation.\n  - Converts the named UUID to a JSON set.\n  - Creates a JSON array containing the parent column name, insert operation, and the JSON set of the named UUID.\n  - Creates a JSON array containing the parent column mutation.\n  - Performs a mutate operation on the specified parent table using OVSDB's multi-transaction API, appending the second transaction to the first one, providing the parent table name, operation type (mutate), where clause, and mutation.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThis function interacts with OVSDB, which is an open-source database management system used for software-defined networking (SDN) and network virtualization.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `ovsdb_sock_path`: Path to the OVSDB socket (not used within the function).\n- `table`: Name of the child table to insert into.\n- `row`: JSON object representing the row to insert.\n- `parent_table`: Name of the parent table to update.\n- `parent_where`: JSON object representing the where clause for the parent table update.\n- `parent_column`: Name of the column in the parent table to update.\n\n**Return value:**\n\n- JSON array representing the multi-transaction to be executed using OVSDB's API.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThis function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component in RDK, which is a widely used software platform for broadband customer-premises equipment (CPE) devices.",
