  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - The `mon_sig_forward` function is a signal handler that forwards SIGTERM and SIGINT signals to a specified PID.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n    - The `mon_sig_forward` function is called when a SIGTERM or SIGINT signal is received.\n    - The function retrieves the PID of the process to which the signal should be forwarded from a global variable.\n    - The signal is then sent to the process using the `kill` system call.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n    - The `mon_sig_forward` function interacts with the `mon_install_parent_signals` function, which sets up the signal handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n    - The `mon_sig_forward` function takes one parameter:\n        - `signum`: The signal number that was received.\n    - The function does not return any value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n    - The `mon_sig_forward` function is not specific to RDK. It can be used in any application that needs to forward signals to a child process.",
