  "response": "## 1. Main purpose and functionality\n\nThe `send_eapol` function is responsible for sending EAPOL (Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN) frames to a specified destination address. EAPOL is used for authentication and key management in 802.1X networks.\n\n## 2. Key operations and data flow\n\nThe main operations and data flow of the `send_eapol` function are as follows:\n\n1. It takes as input a destination address, EAPOL data, the length of the EAPOL data, an encryption flag, the source address, and flags.\n2. It prepends an Ethernet header to the EAPOL data, creating a new frame.\n3. It prints the hexdump of the new frame for debugging purposes.\n4. It adds a delay to handle group rekeying for a large number of clients (workaround for a specific scenario).\n5. It calls the `wifi_hostApSendEther` function to send the new frame over the network.\n6. It frees the memory allocated for the new frame if it was allocated dynamically.\n\n## 3. Interaction with other components (if any)\n\nThe `send_eapol` function interacts with the following components:\n\n1. The `wifi_hostApSendEther` function, which is responsible for sending the EAPOL frame over the network.\n2. The operating system, to allocate and free memory for the new frame.\n\n## 4. Important parameters and return values\n\nThe important parameters and return values of the `send_eapol` function are as follows:\n\n**Parameters:**\n* `priv`: Pointer to the driver data structure.\n* `addr`: Destination MAC address.\n* `data`: EAPOL data.\n* `data_len`: Length of the EAPOL data.\n* `encrypt`: Flag indicating whether the EAPOL frame should be encrypted.\n* `own_addr`: Source MAC address.\n* `flags`: Flags for the EAPOL frame.\n\n**Return value:**\n* `0` on success, or a negative value on error.\n\n## 5. Any specific RDK-related operations\n\nThe `send_eapol` function does not perform any RDK-specific operations.",
