Main Purpose and Functionality:\n\nThe `mon_sig_crash` function is designed to assist in debugging and troubleshooting by handling specific signals and generating stack dumps to diagnose crashes or unexpected behavior.\n\n### 2. Key Operations and Data Flow:\n\n- **Signal Handling:** The function handles a signal specified by the `signum` parameter and performs the following steps:\n  - Retrieves the name of the received signal using `mon_sig_str` and logs it as an alert.\n  - Generates a stack dump using `backtrace_dump`.\n  - If the signal is not SIGUSR2, it re-sends the signal to itself to force a crash, as the signal handler for all other signals has been reset.\n\n### 3.
