  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `auth_frame_received` function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component and is responsible for handling received authentication frames from a wireless station (STA). It takes the received data, including the sender's MAC address and data length, and processes it for further handling by the data plane.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n* The function begins by allocating memory for a `wifi_auth_data_t` struct, which will store information about the received frame.\n* It then copies the received data, sender's MAC address, and length into the `wifi_auth_data_t` struct.\n* The `vap` (Virtual Access Point) index and `dir` (direction of frame) are set.\n* Finally, the function pushes the `wifi_auth_data_t` struct into a data plane queue.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components:**\n\n* The function interacts with the data plane by pushing the `wifi_auth_data_t` struct into a queue.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n* **Parameters**:\n    * `ap_index`: Index of the Access Point that received the frame.\n    * `sta`: MAC address of the STA that sent the frame.\n    * `data`: Pointer to the received frame data.\n    * `len`: Length of the received frame data.\n* **Return value**: None.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\n* This function is part of the RDK, a software framework for developing and deploying cable operator applications.",
