  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `getWiFiBlobVersion` function retrieves the version number of a WiFi blob (a binary file containing configuration data) for a given subdocument (e.g., `wl` for wireless LAN). It reads the version number from the specified subdocument and returns it as a 32-bit unsigned integer.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n* The function accepts a `subdoc` parameter, which specifies the subdocument to read the version number from.\n* It constructs a string `buf` containing the PSM (parameter store management) record path for the version information using the provided `subdoc`.\n* It calls `PSM_Get_Record_Value2` to retrieve the version number as a string from the record path.\n* If the retrieval is successful, it converts the string version number to an unsigned integer and prints trace information.\n* Finally, it returns the version number or 0 if the retrieval was unsuccessful.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\n* The function uses the PSM (parameter store management) module to retrieve the version information from the specified record path.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n* `subdoc`: The subdocument to read the version number from.\n* Return value: The version number of the WiFi blob for the specified subdocument, or 0 if the retrieval was unsuccessful.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\n* The function uses the PSM (parameter store management) module, which is part of the RDK (Reference Design Kit) framework.",
