  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `statusHandler` function is an event handler for RDK's CcspWifiAgent component. It handles events related to the status of WiFi access points (APs).\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n1. The `statusHandler` function is called when an event of type \"Device.WiFi.AccessPoint.%d.Status\" is received.\n2. The function extracts the AP number (`vap`) from the event name.\n3. The function retrieves the \"value\" property from the event data.\n4. If the \"value\" property is present, the function prints a debug message indicating that the AP status has changed to the specified value.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `statusHandler` function interacts with the RBUS (Remote Bus) component to receive events.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n- `handle`: The RBUS handle of the event.\n- `event`: The event object.\n- `subscription`: The event subscription object.\n\nThe function does not return any value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `statusHandler` function uses the RBUS API to receive and process events. This API is specific to RDK.",
