  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - The `ovsdb_cache_pre_fetch` function is primarily used to pre-fetch a row from an Open vSwitch Database (OVSDB) table and store it in the local cache.\n   - This pre-fetching mechanism helps improve the performance of subsequent queries for the same row.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow:**\n   - The function takes three parameters: the path to the OVSDB socket, a pointer to the OVSDB table, and the key of the row to be pre-fetched.\n   - It first checks if the row already exists in the cache. If it does, the function returns immediately.\n   - If the row does not exist, the function constructs a query to fetch the row from the OVSDB server using the `ovsdb_tran_cond()` and `ovsdb_tran_call_s()` functions.\n   - The function parses the result of the query and extracts the UUID of the row.\n   - It then creates a new row object, populates it with the data from the JSON response, and adds it to the cache using the `_ovsdb_cache_insert_row()` function.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components:**\n   - The function interacts with the OVSDB server to retrieve the row data.\n   - It also interacts with the local cache to store the pre-fetched row.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values:**\n   - **Parameters:**\n     - `ovsdb_sock_path`: The path to the OVSDB socket.\n     - `table`: A pointer to the OVSDB table.\n     - `key`: The key of the row to be pre-fetched.\n   - **Return value:**\n     - `0` on success, or `-1` on failure.\n\n5. **Specific RDK-related operations:**\n   - The function does not perform any RDK-specific operations.",
