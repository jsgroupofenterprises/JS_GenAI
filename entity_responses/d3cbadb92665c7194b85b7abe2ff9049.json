  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - The events_CSISetHandler function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component and is responsible for handling set events for properties related to CSI (Channel State Information) Monitoring. It allows configuring the list of MAC addresses to monitor for CSI data and enabling/disabling CSI monitoring for a specific session.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow:**\n   - The function takes three parameters: a handle to the RBUS (Remote Bus) interface, a property indicating which CSI property is being set, and options for the set handler.\n   - It parses the property name to identify the CSI session number and the specific parameter being set (e.g., ClientMaclist or Enable).\n   - For the ClientMaclist parameter, it checks if the new configuration exceeds the maximum number of CSI clients and sets the monitor config accordingly.\n   - For the Enable parameter, it checks if the new configuration affects the total number of unique MAC addresses being monitored and sets the monitor config accordingly.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any):**\n   - The function interacts with the CSI monitoring module to apply the configuration changes.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values:**\n   - **handle:** RBUS handle.\n   - **property:** RBUS property indicating the CSI property being set.\n   - **opts:** Options for the set handler.\n   - **Return value:** RBUS error code.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n   - The function is used to configure CSI monitoring, which is an RDK-specific feature.",
