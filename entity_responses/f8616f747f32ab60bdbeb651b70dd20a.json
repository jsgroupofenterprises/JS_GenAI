  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n   \n   The os_pid_to_name function in CcspWifiAgent retrieves the process name for a given process ID (PID). It is a helper function used to retrieve process information, which can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n   \n   * The function takes three parameters: a PID, a buffer to store the process name, and the length of the buffer.\n   * It constructs a path to the process's comm file in /proc and attempts to open it in read/write mode.\n   * If the file can be opened, it reads the first line of the file, which contains the process name.\n   * The process name is copied into the provided buffer, and the function returns 0 if successful or -1 if an error occurred.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components**\n   \n   The function does not directly interact with other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n   \n   * **pid:** The PID of the process whose name is to be retrieved.\n   * **proc_name:** A buffer to store the process name.\n   * **len:** The length of the proc_name buffer.\n   * **Return value:** 0 if successful, -1 if an error occurred.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n   \n   The function does not perform any RDK-specific operations.",
