  "response": "**Concise Analysis of qm_conn_client**\n\n**1. Main Purpose and Functionality:**\n\n* Establishes a client connection to a UNIX domain socket named \"QM_SOCK_FILENAME.\"\n* The socket is used for communication with a Quality Management (QM) agent.\n\n**2. Key Operations and Data Flow:**\n\n* Creates a socket and binds it to the UNIX domain socket path.\n* Sends a connection request to the QM agent using the socket.\n* Upon successful connection, assigns the file descriptor to the provided pointer.\n\n**3. Interaction with Other Components:**\n\n* Communicates with the QM agent through the socket connection.\n\n**4. Important Parameters and Return Values:**\n\n* **pfd:** Pointer to an integer where the file descriptor of the connected socket will be stored.\n* **Return Type:** Boolean value indicating success (true) or failure (false) of the connection attempt.\n\n**5. Specific RDK-related Operations:**\n\n* Uses RDK-defined constants for the socket file path and directory name:\n    * QM_SOCK_FILENAME\n    * QM_SOCK_DIR\n* Logs information about the connection attempt using RDK logging macros (LOG(), LOG_TRACE).",
