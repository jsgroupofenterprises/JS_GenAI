  "response": "**1. Main Purpose and Functionality**\n\nThe `wifi_radio_cfg_free_resources` function deallocates memory allocated for Wi-Fi radio configuration data. It ensures proper resource management and avoids memory leaks related to Wi-Fi radio configuration.\n\n**2. Key Operations and Data Flow**\n\n* Receives an `execData` structure as an argument, containing pointers to memory allocated for radio configuration data.\n* Checks if the `execData` structure is valid and contains valid data.\n* Deallocates the memory pointed to by `radio_Data->data` and sets the pointer to `NULL` if valid.\n* Frees the memory allocated for the `radio_Data` structure and sets the pointer to `NULL` if valid.\n* Deallocates the memory allocated for the `blob_exec_data` structure and sets the pointer to `NULL`.\n\n**3. Interaction with Other Components (if any)**\n\nThe function does not directly interact with other components but is typically called as part of cleanup operations related to Wi-Fi radio configuration in the RDK environment.\n\n**4. Important Parameters and Return Values**\n\n* **arg (void*)**: Pointer to the `execData` structure containing Wi-Fi radio configuration data.\n* **Return Value (void)**: The function returns nothing as it only deallocates memory and does not return any specific value.\n\n**5. Any Specific RDK-Related Operations**\n\nThe function is part of the RDK's Wi-Fi configuration framework, which provides a standardized way to manage Wi-Fi settings and configurations across different RDK devices and platforms. It is used to clean up resources allocated during Wi-Fi radio configuration operations.",
