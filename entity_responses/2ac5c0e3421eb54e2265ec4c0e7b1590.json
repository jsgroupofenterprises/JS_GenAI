  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `qm_conn_write_req` function is used to write a request to a QM (Quality Measurement) connection. \nIt takes a file descriptor, a request structure, a topic, data, and the data size as input and writes the request to the connection. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the write was successful.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function first calculates the total size of the request, including the request structure, topic, and data.\nIf the total size is less than or equal to the maximum size for a compact send, the function merges all of the data into a single buffer and sends it using a single `send` call. Otherwise, the function sends the request structure, topic, and data separately using multiple `send` calls.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `qm_conn_write_req` function interacts with the QM daemon through the QM connection. The function sends the request to the daemon, and the daemon processes the request and responds accordingly.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following are the important parameters and return values of the `qm_conn_write_req` function:\n\n* `fd`: The file descriptor of the QM connection.\n* `req`: A pointer to the request structure.\n* `topic`: The topic of the request.\n* `data`: The data to be sent with the request.\n* `data_size`: The size of the data.\n* `return value`: A boolean value indicating whether the write was successful.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `qm_conn_write_req` function is used by RDK components to send requests to the QM daemon. The daemon is responsible for collecting and processing quality of service (QoS) data from various sources. The requests sent by the `qm_conn_write_req` function are used to control the collection and processing of QoS data.",
