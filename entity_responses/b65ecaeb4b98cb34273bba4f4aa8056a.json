  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThis function is used to set the DPP configuration to be used by the RDK Wi-Fi HAL. This configuration includes the DPP listen channel, the DPP role of the device, and the DPP bootstrapping key for the device. The Wi-Fi HAL uses this configuration to handle DPP requests from other devices.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow:**\n\nThe key operations of this function are as follows:\n\n1. The function takes the following input parameters:\n\n    - `apIndex`: The index of the access point for which the DPP configuration is being set.\n    - `config`: A pointer to a `wifi_dppConfig_t` structure containing the DPP configuration to be set.\n\n2. The function validates the input parameters.\n\n3. The function sets the DPP configuration in the Wi-Fi HAL.\n\n4. The function returns a status code indicating the success or failure of the operation.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThis function interacts with the Wi-Fi HAL to set the DPP configuration.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values:**\n\nThe following parameters are important to note:\n\n- `apIndex`: The index of the access point for which the DPP configuration is being set.\n- `config`: A pointer to a `wifi_dppConfig_t` structure containing the DPP configuration to be set.\n\nThe following return values are important to note:\n\n- `RETURN_OK`: The DPP configuration was successfully set.\n- `RETURN_ERR`: The DPP configuration could not be set.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThis function is specific to RDK Wi-Fi HAL.",
