  "response": "### 1. Main purpose and functionality:\n\nThe 'find_best_dpp_channel' function iterates over a list of channels and attempts to find the optimal channel for Wi-Fi Direct Protected Setup (DPP) operations. It selects the next channel from the list on each call and increments the current attempt count. The function returns the channel number if a suitable channel is found, or -1 if no more channels are available.\n\n### 2. Key operations and data flow:\n\n1. The function checks if the current attempt count is less than the total number of channels available.\n2. If there are more channels to try, it retrieves the next channel number from the list and increments the current attempt count.\n3. The function then returns the selected channel number.\n\n### 3. Interaction with other components:\n\nThis function appears to be primarily used within the CcspWifiAgent component for managing Wi-Fi DPP operations. It interacts with the Wi-Fi easy connect (EC) framework for debugging and logging.\n\n### 4. Important parameters and return values:\n\n* **'ctx'**: A pointer to a 'wifi_device_dpp_context_t' structure, which contains information related to the Wi-Fi DPP operation, including the list of channels to try and the current attempt count.\n* **Return value**: The function returns an integer representing the selected channel number. If no more channels are available, it returns -1 to indicate failure.\n\n### 5. Any specific RDK-related operations:\n\nThe function itself does not appear to have any RDK-specific operations. However, the debugging prints use debug macros defined within the RDK's Wi-Fi EC framework.",
