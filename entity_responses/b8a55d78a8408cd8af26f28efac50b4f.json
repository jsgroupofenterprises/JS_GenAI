  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `qm_conn_send_stream` function in RDK's CcspWifiAgent component is responsible for sending a stream of data over a qm_conn_t connection. It takes a qm_conn_t connection, a qm_request_t request, a topic string, data to send, data size, and a qm_response_t response as input. The function sends the data using `qm_conn_send_fd` and handles connection errors by attempting to reconnect and resend the data.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n1. The function first checks if the qm_conn_t connection (qc) is initialized and returns false if it's not.\n2. It then checks if the remote end has closed the connection and attempts to reconnect if necessary.\n3. The data is sent using `qm_conn_send_fd`.\n4. If the send operation fails due to a connection error, the function attempts to reconnect and resend the data.\n5. Finally, the function sets the qm_response_t response (res) to the value of the internal qc->res and returns the result of the send operation.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThe `qm_conn_send_stream` function interacts with other components in the CcspWifiAgent such as `qm_conn_check_reconnect` and `qm_conn_reopen`  to handle connection errors.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n* **qc**: A pointer to the qm_conn_t connection to send the data over.\n* **req**: A pointer to the qm_request_t request to send.\n* **topic**: A string representing the topic to send the data on.\n* **data**: A pointer to the data to send.\n* **data_size**: The size of the data to send.\n* **res**: A pointer to the qm_response_t response to fill in.\n\nThe function returns true if the data was sent successfully, and false otherwise.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThe `qm_conn_send_stream` function uses the RDK-specific `qm_conn_send_fd` function to send the data.",
