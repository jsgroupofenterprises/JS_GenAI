  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `voice_hal_getCCTKTraceLevel` function in RDK is used to get the CCTK trace level for a given voice service. CCTK is a logging library that is used by the RDK Voice HAL to log debugging information. The trace level specifies the amount of debugging information that is logged, with higher levels logging more information.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe following are the key operations and data flow of the `voice_hal_getCCTKTraceLevel` function:\n\n1. The function takes the following parameters:\n    - `service`: The voice service for which to get the CCTK trace level.\n    - `traceLevel`: A pointer to a buffer in which to store the CCTK trace level.\n    - `pLength`: A pointer to a variable in which to store the length of the trace level buffer.\n2. The function gets the CCTK trace level for the specified voice service.\n3. The function stores the CCTK trace level in the trace level buffer.\n4. The function returns the length of the CCTK trace level buffer.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `voice_hal_getCCTKTraceLevel` function does not directly interact with any other components. However, it uses the CCTK logging library to log debugging information.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following are the important parameters and return values of the `voice_hal_getCCTKTraceLevel` function:\n\n- `service`: The voice service for which to get the CCTK trace level.\n- `traceLevel`: A pointer to a buffer in which to store the CCTK trace level.\n- `pLength`: A pointer to a variable in which to store the length of the trace level buffer.\n- The function returns the length of the CCTK trace level buffer.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `voice_hal_getCCTKTraceLevel` function is a specific RDK-related operation. It is used to get the CCTK trace level for a given voice service, which can be used to control the amount of logging that is performed by the RDK Voice HAL.",
