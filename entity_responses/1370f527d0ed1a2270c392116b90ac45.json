  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**\n\n   - The `auth_frame_sent` function in the CcspWifiAgent component of RDK is part of the Wi-Fi authentication process. It is called when an authentication frame is sent to a station (STA).\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**\n\n   - The function takes the following parameters:\n     - `ap_index`: The index of the access point (AP) that sent the frame.\n     - `sta`: The MAC address of the STA that received the frame.\n     - `data`: A pointer to the data in the frame.\n     - `len`: The length of the data in the frame.\n   - The function then processes the data in the frame and updates the internal state of the Wi-Fi agent.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\n   - The `auth_frame_sent` function interacts with the following components:\n     - The Wi-Fi driver: The function sends the authentication frame to the Wi-Fi driver, which then transmits the frame to the STA.\n     - The Wi-Fi agent: The function updates the internal state of the Wi-Fi agent to reflect the fact that an authentication frame has been sent.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**\n\n   - The `ap_index` parameter is important because it identifies the AP that sent the frame.\n   - The `sta` parameter is important because it identifies the STA that received the frame.\n   - The `data` and `len` parameters are important because they contain the data in the frame.\n   - The function does not return a value.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\n   - The `auth_frame_sent` function is part of the RDK Wi-Fi agent, which is a component of the RDK software stack.",
