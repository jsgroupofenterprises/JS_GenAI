  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n     - hapd_process_disassoc_frame function is used to process the disassociation frame which means that the station is disconnected from the access point.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n    - The function takes as parameters the ap_index which is the index of the access point, the sta which is the mac address of the station that disconnected, and the reason which is the reason for the disassociation.\n    - The function first checks if the access point is started and if it is not, it returns -1.\n    - If the access point is started, the function calls the hostapd_notif_disassoc function to notify the hostapd about the disassociation.\n    - The hostapd_notif_disassoc function will then take care of removing the station from the list of associated stations and updating the host driver.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n    - The hapd_process_disassoc_frame function interacts with the hostapd component.\n    - The hostapd component is responsible for managing the access point and handling the association and disassociation of stations.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n    - ap_index: The index of the access point.\n    - sta: The mac address of the station that disconnected.\n    - reason: The reason for the disassociation.\n    - Return value: The function returns 0 if the disassociation was successful, or -1 if the access point was not started.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n    - This function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
