  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `wifi_receivedMgmtFrame_callback` function is a callback function that is used to register a callback to be executed when a management frame is received by the HAL. The callback function takes two parameters:\n\n* `apIndex`: The index of the AP that received the management frame.\n* `frame`: A pointer to the management frame.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe key operations and data flow of the `wifi_receivedMgmtFrame_callback` function are as follows:\n\n1. The callback function is registered using the `wifi_mgmt_frame_callbacks_register()` function.\n2. When a management frame is received by the HAL, the callback function is executed.\n3. The callback function can process the management frame and take any necessary actions.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `wifi_receivedMgmtFrame_callback` function interacts with the following components:\n\n* The HAL: The HAL provides the callback function with the management frame that was received.\n* The application: The application can register a callback function to be executed when a management frame is received.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following are the important parameters and return values of the `wifi_receivedMgmtFrame_callback` function:\n\n* Parameters:\n    * `apIndex`: The index of the AP that received the management frame.\n    * `frame`: A pointer to the management frame.\n* Return value: The callback function returns an integer value indicating the status of the operation.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `wifi_receivedMgmtFrame_callback` function is not specific to RDK, but it can be used by RDK applications to process management frames that are received by the HAL.",
