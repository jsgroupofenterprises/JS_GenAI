  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - The `fsa_copy()` function is used to copy data from an FSA (Flexible Storage Array) to a destination buffer. FSA is a storage structure used by the CcspWifiAgent component in RDK to store data items of variable size.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n   - The function loops through the FSA, copying each item to the destination buffer.\n   - It checks for out-of-bounds conditions to ensure that the copying operation does not overwrite memory beyond the specified limits.\n   - The number of items successfully copied is stored in the `dnum` parameter\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n   - The `fsa_copy()` function interacts with the FSA storage structure and the destination buffer.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n   - The important parameters are:\n     - `array`: Pointer to the FSA to copy from\n     - `size`: Size of each item in the FSA\n     - `len`: Length of the FSA\n     - `num`: Number of items to copy\n     - `dest`: Pointer to the destination buffer\n     - `dsize`: Size of each item in the destination buffer\n     - `dlen`: Length of the destination buffer\n     - `dnum`: Pointer to an integer that will store the number of items successfully copied\n   - The function returns nothing (void).\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n   - The `fsa_copy()` function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component in RDK and is used for managing FSA data structures.",
