  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**:\n   - The NetmaskToNumber function takes a string representing a network mask, e.g., \"255.255.255.0\", and converts it into a 32-bit unsigned integer representing the number of bits set to 1 in the mask.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n   - The function uses strtok_r() to split the netmask string into four octets (e.g., \"255\", \"255\", \"255\", \"0\").\n   - For each octet, the function converts it to an integer using atoi() and then iterates through the bits of the integer, checking if each bit is set to 1.\n   - If a bit is set to 1, the function increments a count variable.\n   - The function returns the count variable, which represents the number of bits set to 1 in the netmask.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components**:\n   - This function is typically used by other components that need to determine the subnet size or the number of hosts on a network.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n   - **netmask**: A string representing the network mask in dotted-decimal notation.\n   - **Return value**: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the number of bits set to 1 in the netmask.\n\n5. **Specific RDK-related operations**:\n   - None.",
