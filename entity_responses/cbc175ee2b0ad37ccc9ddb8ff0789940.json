  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe purpose of `CcspHalEthSwLocatePortByMacAddress` function is to locate the port number of an Ethernet device given its MAC address. This function is part of the RDK Ethernet HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) component.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n- `mac`: A pointer to the MAC address of the Ethernet device.\n- `port`: A pointer to an integer to store the port number of the Ethernet device.\n\nThe function first checks if the MAC address is valid. If the MAC address is not valid, the function returns -1.\n\nIf the MAC address is valid, the function searches through a list of Ethernet devices to find the device with the matching MAC address. If the device is found, the function stores the port number of the device in the `port` parameter and returns 0.\n\nIf the device is not found, the function returns -1.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThis function does not interact with any other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n- **Parameters:**\n  - `mac`: A pointer to the MAC address of the Ethernet device.\n  - `port`: A pointer to an integer to store the port number of the Ethernet device.\n- **Return values:**\n  - 0 if the device is found and the port number is stored in the `port` parameter.\n  - -1 if the device is not found or the MAC address is not valid.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThis function is part of the RDK Ethernet HAL component. The Ethernet HAL component provides a set of functions that can be used to manage Ethernet devices.",
