  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `parse_uri` function in the CcspWifiAgent component of the RDK separates a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) into its protocol, host, and port components. It then validates the protocol and the presence of a valid host and port.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes a URI string as input and parses it into three output variables:\n\n* `proto`: a buffer to store the protocol (e.g., \"ssl\" or \"tcp\")\n* `host`: a buffer to store the host name or IP address\n* `port`: a pointer to an integer to store the port number\n\nThe function uses the `strtok_r` function to split the URI string into its components and validates the protocol and the presence of a valid host and port. If the URI is valid, the function copies the protocol, host, and port into the output buffers and returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `parse_uri` function does not directly interact with any other components. However, it is likely used by other components in the RDK that need to parse URIs.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n* `uri`: The URI string to parse.\n* `proto`: A buffer to store the protocol (e.g., \"ssl\" or \"tcp\").\n* `proto_size`: The size of the `proto` buffer.\n* `host`: A buffer to store the host name or IP address.\n* `host_size`: The size of the `host` buffer.\n* `port`: A pointer to an integer to store the port number.\n\n**Return value:**\n\n* `true` if the URI is valid and has been parsed successfully.\n* `false` if the URI is invalid or could not be parsed.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `parse_uri` function does not perform any RDK-specific operations. It is a general-purpose function that can be used by any component that needs to parse URIs.",
