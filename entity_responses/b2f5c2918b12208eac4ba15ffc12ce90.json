Main purpose and functionality:**\n- The WifiClient_Default_Commit function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component and is responsible for committing changes made to the Wi-Fi client's default settings.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n- The function takes a handle to the context of the instance that is being modified (hInsContext) as input.\n- It then retrieves the current Wi-Fi object and harvester objects.\n- The function checks if any changes have been made to the default reporting period or override TTL for the Wi-Fi client.\n- If any changes have been made, it updates the relevant settings in the NVRAM configuration and sets the appropriate flags in the harvester object.\n- Finally, it calls the CosaDmlWiFiClient functions to update the default reporting period and override TTL values for the Wi-Fi client.\n\n**3.
