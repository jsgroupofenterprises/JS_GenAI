Main purpose and functionality\n\nThe logger_traceback_match function is used to determine whether to include a log message in a traceback buffer. It always returns true, indicating that all log messages should be included in the traceback buffer.\n\n### 2. Key operations and data flow\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n- `sev`: The severity of the log message.\n- `module`: The module that generated the log message.\n\nHowever, the function does not use these parameters in making its decision. Instead, it always returns true, indicating that all log messages should be included in the traceback buffer.\n\n### 3. Interaction with other components (if any)\n\nThe function does not interact with any other components directly. However, the traceback buffer is used by other components to provide context for errors.\n\n### 4. Important parameters and return values\n\n- `sev`: The severity of the log message. (Unused)\n- `module`: The module that generated the log message. (Unused)\n- Return value: True if the log message should be included in the traceback buffer.\n\n### 5.
