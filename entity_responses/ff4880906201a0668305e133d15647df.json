  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\n- `process_packet_timeout` is a callback function invoked whenever a data packet transmission operation times out on the network without receiving an acknowledgment.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n- The function takes two parameters: `packet`, a pointer to the data packet that timed out, and `module`, a pointer to the `wifi_data_plane_t` data structure representing the Wi-Fi data plane module.\n- The function currently does not perform any specific operations on the received parameters. It treats them as unused by marking them as `UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER`.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\n- This function is typically called by the Wi-Fi data plane module when a data transmission operation times out.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n- `packet`: A pointer to the `wifi_data_plane_packet_t` data structure representing the timed-out data packet.\n- `module`: A pointer to the `wifi_data_plane_t` data structure representing the Wi-Fi data plane module.\n- The function does not return any value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\n- The function does not perform any explicit RDK-related operations.",
