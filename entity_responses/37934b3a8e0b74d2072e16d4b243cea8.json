  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**:\nThe `waitForEthAgentComponentReady` function is used to wait for the EthAgent component to become ready before proceeding.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**:\n- The function first initializes variables, such as `status` and `count`.\n- It then enters a loop that continues until the EthAgent component is ready.\n- Within the loop, the function checks the health status of the EthAgent component using the `checkComponentHealthStatus` function.\n- If the EthAgent component is healthy (status is \"Green\"), the loop breaks.\n- If the EthAgent component is not healthy, the function increments the `count` variable and sleeps for 5 seconds.\n- If the `count` variable exceeds 60, the loop breaks and the function returns.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components**:\nThe `waitForEthAgentComponentReady` function interacts with the `checkComponentHealthStatus` function to check the health status of the EthAgent component.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**:\nThe `waitForEthAgentComponentReady` function does not have any parameters and does not return any values.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**:\nThe `waitForEthAgentComponentReady` function uses the `checkComponentHealthStatus` function, which is part of the RDK. The function also uses the `RDKB_ETHAGENT_COMPONENT_NAME` and `RDKB_ETHAGENT_DBUS_PATH` macros, which are defined in the RDK header files.",
