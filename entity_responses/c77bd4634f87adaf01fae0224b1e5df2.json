  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - The `events_subHandler` function is part of the CcspWifiAgent software component in RDK.\n   - It is responsible for handling subscription requests for RDK events.\n   - It allows clients to register for event notifications and specify filters to receive only specific events of interest.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n   - The function takes several parameters, including the Rbus handle, the event subscription action (add or remove), the event name, a filter, an interval, and a pointer to a boolean indicating whether to automatically publish events.\n   - It then either adds or removes the event subscription based on the action parameter.\n   - If adding a subscription, it uses the Rbus library to create a subscription for the specified event name, filter, and interval.\n   - If removing a subscription, it uses the Rbus library to remove the subscription for the specified event name.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components:**\n   - The `events_subHandler` function interacts with the Rbus library to create and remove event subscriptions.\n   - It also interacts with other components in the CcspWifiAgent to handle incoming events and publish them to clients.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n   - **rbusHandle_t handle:** The Rbus handle used for communication with the Rbus library.\n   - **rbusEventSubAction_t action:** The event subscription action to perform (add or remove).\n   - **const char* eventName:** The name of the event to subscribe to or unsubscribe from.\n   - **rbusFilter_t filter:** The filter to use when subscribing to events.\n   - **int32_t interval:** The interval (in milliseconds) at which to receive events.\n   - **bool* autoPublish:** A pointer to a boolean indicating whether to automatically publish events when they are received.\n   - **rbusError_t:** The return value of the function, indicating success or failure.\n\n**5. Specific RDK-related operations:**\n   - The `events_subHandler` function relies on the Rbus library, which is part of the RDK framework.\n   - It is used to manage event subscriptions for RDK events, which are defined by the RDK software platform.",
