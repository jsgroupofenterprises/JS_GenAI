  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - The main purpose of this RDK function is to collect and upload data about associated devices on the network, including information such as device type, signal strength, and interference sources. This data is used for network monitoring and troubleshooting.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow:**\n   - The function takes as input a pointer to a `bssid_data_t` structure, which contains information about a specific BSSID, and a pointer to a `sta_data_t` structure, which contains information about a specific STA associated with that BSSID.\n   - The function first generates an Avro schema for the data to be uploaded.\n   - The function then creates an Avro writer and uses it to write the data to a buffer.\n   - The function finally sends the buffer to the webpa service using the `sendWebpaMsg()` function.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any):**\n   - The function interacts with the following components:\n     - The webpa service, which receives the data and stores it in a database.\n     - The wifi monitor, which provides information about the BSSIDs and STAs on the network.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values:**\n   - **Parameters:**\n     - `bssid_info`: A pointer to a `bssid_data_t` structure containing information about a specific BSSID.\n     - `sta_info`: A pointer to a `sta_data_t` structure containing information about a specific STA associated with that BSSID.\n   - **Return value:**\n     - None.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n   - The function uses the `sendWebpaMsg()` function to send the data to the webpa service. This function is part of the RDK software suite.",
