  "response": "### Main Purpose and Functionality\n\nThe `platform_hal_GetUsedMemorySize` function is designed to retrieve the amount of used memory within the device's DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory). This information provides insights into the current memory utilization of the system, allowing for memory management and optimization.\n\n### Key Operations and Data Flow\n\n1. The function takes a pointer to an unsigned long integer (`ULONG *pulSize`) as a parameter.\n2. It internally calculates the used memory size.\n3. The calculated used memory size is stored in the memory location pointed to by `pulSize`.\n\n### Interaction with Other Components (if any)\n\nThis function does not directly interact with any other components.\n\n### Important Parameters and Return Values\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `pulSize`: A pointer to an unsigned long integer where the function will store the used memory size.\n\n**Return Values:**\n\n- `RETURN_OK`: Indicates successful execution and the used memory size retrieval.\n- `RETURN_ERR`: Indicates that an error occurred during execution, and the used memory size could not be retrieved.\n\n### Specific RDK-related Operations\n\nThe `platform_hal_GetUsedMemorySize` function is part of the RDK (Reference Design Kit) HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) component, which provides a standardized interface for accessing hardware-specific functionality across different RDK-compliant devices. This function allows developers to obtain the used memory size information consistently across different devices supported by RDK.",
