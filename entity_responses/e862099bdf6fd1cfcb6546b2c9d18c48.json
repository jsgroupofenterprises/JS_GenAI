  "response": "**Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `qm_conn_send_log` function opens a connection to the Qualcomm Quality Management (QM) service (if not already opened) and sends a log message to the service. It is used to send diagnostic and debugging information from the CcspWifiAgent component to the QM service.\n\n**Key operations and data flow:**\n\n1. The function obtains a pointer to the `qm_conn_log_handle` connection object and checks if it has been initialized. If not, it calls `qm_conn_open` to initialize the connection.\n2. A `qm_request_t` request object is initialized with the following parameters:\n   - `cmd`: QM_CMD_SEND (command to send data)\n   - `data_type`: QM_DATA_LOG (type of data being sent is a log message)\n   - `compress`: QM_REQ_COMPRESS_DISABLE (compression is disabled)\n   - `flags`: QM_REQ_FLAG_NO_RESPONSE (indicates that no response is expected)\n3. The `qm_conn_send_stream` function is called to send the request and the log message data to the QM service. The `res` parameter is set to NULL to indicate that no response is expected.\n4. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the send operation was successful.\n\n**Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\n- The function interacts with the Qualcomm Quality Management (QM) service to send log messages.\n\n**Important parameters and return values:**\n\n- `msg`: Pointer to the log message to be sent.\n- `res`: Pointer to a `qm_response_t` object to receive the response from the QM service (set to NULL in this function as no response is expected).\n- Return value: Boolean indicating whether the send operation was successful.\n\n**Specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThe function utilizes the Qualcomm Quality Management (QM) service, which is an RDK-specific component for collecting and managing diagnostic and debugging information from RDK devices.",
