  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `webconf_ssid_free_resources` function is responsible for freeing the resources allocated for Wi-Fi web configuration. It is typically called when the web configuration process is complete or when an error occurs.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes a single argument, `arg`, which is a pointer to an `execData` structure. This structure contains a pointer to a `webconf_wifi_t` structure, which contains the data needed for Wi-Fi web configuration.\n\nThe function first checks if the `arg` argument is `NULL`. If it is, the function returns immediately, indicating that an error has occurred.\n\nIf the `arg` argument is not `NULL`, the function casts it to an `execData` structure and then frees the memory allocated for the `execData` structure.\n\nThe function then casts the `user_data` field of the `execData` structure to a `webconf_wifi_t` structure and frees the memory allocated for the `webconf_wifi_t` structure.\n\nFinally, the function sets the `ps_data` pointer to `NULL` to indicate that the resources have been freed.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `webconf_ssid_free_resources` function does not interact with any other components directly. However, it is typically called by the `webconf_ssid_start` function, which is responsible for starting the Wi-Fi web configuration process.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe only parameter to the `webconf_ssid_free_resources` function is `arg`. This argument is a pointer to an `execData` structure.\n\nThe function does not return any value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `webconf_ssid_free_resources` function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
