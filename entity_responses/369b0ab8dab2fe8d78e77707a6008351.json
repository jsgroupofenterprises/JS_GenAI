  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n- The `os_atol` function in the CcspWifiAgent component is used to convert a null-terminated string (`str`) representing a numeric value into a signed long integer (`long`).\n- It delegates this task to the `os_strtoul` function, which performs a similar conversion but expects an unsigned long as the output.\n- By setting the third parameter of `os_strtoul` to 0, `os_atol` effectively performs a signed conversion.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n- The function receives a pointer to a null-terminated string (`str`) and a pointer to a long integer (`out`) to store the result.\n- It invokes `os_strtoul` with the input string, the output pointer, and a base of 0.\n- `os_strtoul` parses the string, converting characters to digits and multiplying them by the appropriate powers of the base.\n- It continues until a non-numeric character or the null-terminator is encountered.\n- The resulting unsigned long is stored in the `out` pointer.\n- The function returns the value returned by `os_strtoul`, indicating success or failure.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n- The function does not interact with other components directly.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n- **str**: A pointer to the null-terminated string to be converted.\n- **out**: A pointer to the long integer to store the result.\n- **Return value**: Returns `true` if the conversion was successful, and `false` otherwise.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n- The function does not perform any RDK-specific operations.",
