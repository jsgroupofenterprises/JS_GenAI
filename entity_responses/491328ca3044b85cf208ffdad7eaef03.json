  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `remove_character` function removes all occurrences of a specified character from a null-terminated string.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n- The function loops through the characters of the string, using two pointers `i` and `j`.\n- If the current character at `j` is not equal to the character to be removed, the character is copied to the position pointed to by `i`.\n- If the current character is equal to the character to be removed, `i` is advanced without copying the character.\n- `i` always points to the first character after the last character copied to the string.\n- When `j` reaches the end of the string, it is terminated with a null character.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nNone.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n- `str`: A pointer to the null-terminated string from which the character is to be removed.\n- `character`: The character to be removed from the string.\n- The function does not have a return value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nNone.",
