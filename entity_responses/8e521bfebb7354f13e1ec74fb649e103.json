  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe purpose of wifi_getFTResourceRequestSupported function is to retrieve the Fast Transition (FT) resource request support value for a specified access point (AP) index. FT is a mechanism that allows a mobile station (MS) to roam between APs without the need for a full authentication and association process. The FT resource request support value indicates whether the AP supports FT resource requests.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe wifi_getFTResourceRequestSupported function takes two parameters:\n\n* **apIndex:** The index of the AP for which the FT resource request support value is being queried.\n* **supported:** A pointer to a boolean variable that will be set to TRUE if FT resource requests are supported by the AP, or FALSE if they are not supported.\n\nThe function first checks if the specified AP index is valid. If the AP index is invalid, the function returns RETURN_ERR. Otherwise, the function retrieves the FT resource request support value from the AP and stores it in the variable pointed to by supported. The function then returns RETURN_OK.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe wifi_getFTResourceRequestSupported function does not interact with any other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* **apIndex:** The index of the AP for which the FT resource request support value is being queried.\n* **supported:** A pointer to a boolean variable that will be set to TRUE if FT resource requests are supported by the AP, or FALSE if they are not supported.\n* **RETURN_OK:** The function was successful.\n* **RETURN_ERR:** The function failed.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe wifi_getFTResourceRequestSupported function is not specific to RDK. It can be used in any application that needs to query the FT resource request support value for an AP.",
