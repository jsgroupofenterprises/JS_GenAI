  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP) involves two mobile devices or two distinct Wi-Fi interfaces to wirelessly configure secure Wi-Fi access to Wi-Fi Network.\n   - Key operations and data flow:\n     - Authentication: DPP authentication using QR code.\n     - Provisioning: 1) Enrollee sends a request to provision with the Wi-Fi device running DPP; 2) Provisioner verifies the Enrollee and passes or fails the request; 3) If the request is passed, the device is added to the network.\n     - Data flow: 1) Enrollee device scans for QR code or NFC tag; 2) Enrollee takes image of QR or taps NFC tag and authenticates using the Wi-Fi app; 3) Provisioner validates the token and grants access to the Wi-Fi network.\n   - Interaction with other components:\n     - DPP works with other Wi-Fi components like the Wi-Fi network and the Wi-Fi driver.\n     - It interacts with the provisioning application on the device.\n   - Important parameters and return values:\n     - Error codes: DPP_ERR_SUCCESS, DPP_ERR_FAILURE, DPP_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT, DPP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED, DPP_ERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY, DPP_ERR_TIMEOUT, DPP_ERR_NETWORK_ERROR, DPP_ERR_QR_CODE_INVALID, DPP_ERR_NFC_TAG_INVALID, DPP_ERR_WIFI_NETWORK_INVALID, DPP_ERR_WIFI_DRIVER_ERROR, DPP_ERR_PROVISIONING_APPLICATION_ERROR.\n   - Any specific RDK-related operations:\n     - DPP is used in RDK to provision new devices to the network.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n   - Authentication:\n     1. The Enrollee scans the QR code or NFC tag.\n     2. The Enrollee takes an image of the QR code or taps the NFC tag.\n     3. The Enrollee authenticates using the Wi-Fi app.\n   - Provisioning:\n     1. The Enrollee sends a request to provision with the Wi-Fi device running DPP.\n     2. The Provisioner verifies the Enrollee and passes or fails the request.\n     3. If the request is passed, the device is added to the network.\n   - Data flow:\n     1. The Enrollee device scans for a QR code or NFC tag.\n     2. The Enrollee takes an image of the QR code or taps the NFC tag.\n     3. The Enrollee app extracts the DPP configuration information from the QR code or NFC tag.\n     4. The Enrollee app sends the DPP configuration information to the Provisioner.\n     5. The Provisioner verifies the DPP configuration information.\n     6. The Provisioner adds the Enrollee to the Wi-Fi network.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components:**\n   - DPP works with other Wi-Fi components like the Wi-Fi network and the Wi-Fi driver.\n   - It interacts with the provisioning application on the device.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n   - Error codes:\n     - DPP_ERR_SUCCESS: The operation was successful.\n     - DPP_ERR_FAILURE: The operation failed.\n     - DPP_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT: An invalid argument was passed to the function.\n     - DPP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED: The operation is not supported.\n     - DPP_ERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY: The operation failed due to a lack of memory.\n     - DPP_ERR_TIMEOUT: The operation timed out.\n     - DPP_ERR_NETWORK_ERROR: The operation failed due to a network error.\n     - DPP_ERR_QR_CODE_INVALID: The QR code is invalid.\n     - DPP_ERR_NFC_TAG_INVALID: The NFC tag is invalid.\n     - DPP_ERR_WIFI_NETWORK_INVALID: The Wi-Fi network is invalid.\n     - DPP_ERR_WIFI_DRIVER_ERROR: The Wi-Fi driver failed to perform the operation.\n     - DPP_ERR_PROVISIONING_APPLICATION_ERROR: The provisioning application failed to perform the operation.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n   - DPP is used in RDK to provision new devices to the network.",
