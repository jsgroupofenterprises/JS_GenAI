  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe wifi_apDeAuthEvent_callback function is used to register a callback function that will be called when a client device is deauthenticated from an access point (AP). The callback function will be passed the index of the AP, the MAC address of the client device, and the reason for the deauthentication.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe wifi_apDeAuthEvent_callback function takes a single parameter, which is a pointer to the callback function that will be called when a client device is deauthenticated from an AP. The callback function must have the following signature:\n\n```C\ntypedef INT (*wifi_apDeAuthEvent_callback)(int ap_index, char *mac, int reason);\n```\n\nWhen a client device is deauthenticated from an AP, the RDK HAL will call the registered callback function. The callback function will be passed the index of the AP, the MAC address of the client device, and the reason for the deauthentication.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe wifi_apDeAuthEvent_callback function interacts with the RDK HAL. The RDK HAL is responsible for managing the APs and client devices.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe wifi_apDeAuthEvent_callback function takes a single parameter, which is a pointer to the callback function that will be called when a client device is deauthenticated from an AP. The callback function must have the following signature:\n\n```C\ntypedef INT (*wifi_apDeAuthEvent_callback)(int ap_index, char *mac, int reason);\n```\n\nThe callback function will be passed the index of the AP, the MAC address of the client device, and the reason for the deauthentication.\n\nThe wifi_apDeAuthEvent_callback function returns an INT value. The return value is the status of the operation. The following are the possible return values:\n\n* RETURN_OK if successful\n* RETURN_ERR if any error is detected\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe wifi_apDeAuthEvent_callback function is an RDK-specific function. It is used to register a callback function that will be called when a client device is deauthenticated from an AP.",
