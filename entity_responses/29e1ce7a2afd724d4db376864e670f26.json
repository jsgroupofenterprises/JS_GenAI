It creates and initializes the necessary objects for the agent to operate.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n* The function first checks if the agent is running in a simulation environment and sets the appropriate flags.\n* It then creates the following objects:\n    * `hWifi`: A handle to the CosaWifi object, responsible for managing Wi-Fi devices and configurations\n    * `hLogging`: A handle to the CosaLogging object, responsible for logging events and messages\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThe `CosaBackEndManagerInitialize` function does not directly interact with other components. However, the objects it creates may interact with components such as the Hub Manager and the Broadband Forum Clients.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n* `hThisObject`: The handle to the CcspWifiAgent object being initialized\n* `returnStatus`: The status of the initialization process. Success is indicated by `ANSC_STATUS_SUCCESS`.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThe `CosaBackEndManagerInitialize` function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations. However, the objects it creates may use RDK-specific APIs and functionality.",
