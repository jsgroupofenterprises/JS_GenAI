  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\nThe wifi_getLayer2TrafficInspectionFiltering function is used to enable or disable Layer 2 Traffic Inspection and Filtering feature on a wireless access point. \nThis feature allows the AP to inspect and filter incoming traffic based on its Layer 2 headers.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\nThe function takes two parameters:\n- apIndex: The index of the AP to configure.\n- enabled: A pointer to a BOOL variable that will be set to TRUE if Layer 2 Traffic Inspection and Filtering is enabled, or FALSE if it is disabled.\n\nThe function first checks if the apIndex parameter is valid. If it is not, the function returns an error code.\nIf the apIndex parameter is valid, the function sends a message to the Wi-Fi driver to configure Layer 2 Traffic Inspection and Filtering. The driver then returns a status code to the function, which is returned to the caller.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\nThe wifi_getLayer2TrafficInspectionFiltering function interacts with the Wi-Fi driver to configure Layer 2 Traffic Inspection and Filtering.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\nThe important parameters of the wifi_getLayer2TrafficInspectionFiltering function are:\n- apIndex: The index of the AP to configure.\n- enabled: A pointer to a BOOL variable that will be set to TRUE if Layer 2 Traffic Inspection and Filtering is enabled, or FALSE if it is disabled.\n\nThe function returns an INT value, which is the status code of the operation. \nA value of RETURN_OK indicates that the operation was successful. Any other value indicates an error occurred.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\nThe wifi_getLayer2TrafficInspectionFiltering function is not specific to RDK. It can be used in any operating system that supports the Wi-Fi driver.",
