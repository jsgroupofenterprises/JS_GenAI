  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `ds_void_cmp` function is a comparison function that compares two void pointers and returns an integer representing the result of the comparison.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes two void pointers, `a` and `b`, and compares them by subtracting the value of `b` from the value of `a`. The result of the subtraction is returned as an integer.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `ds_void_cmp` function is not known to interact with any other RDK components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* **Parameters:**\n    * `a`: A void pointer to the first value to compare.\n    * `b`: A void pointer to the second value to compare.\n* **Return value:**\n    * An integer representing the result of the comparison. A positive value indicates that `a` is greater than `b`, a negative value indicates that `a` is less than `b`, and zero indicates that `a` is equal to `b`.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `ds_void_cmp` function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
