Main purpose and functionality \n\nDevice Provisioning Protocol is a protocol that enables fast and easy provisioning of devices.\nThis RDK HAL supports DPP for the Wi-Fi portion of the deployment. The Wi-Fi HAL also\nsupports Easy Connect for inter-operability with non-DPP capable devices.\nDPP and Easy Connect are part of the Wi-Fi Alliance's \"Easy Connect Certification Program\"\nfor faster and simpler home networking setup by automating network naming and password management.\n\n2. Key operations and data flow \n\nDPP uses public-key cryptography to establish a secure connection.\nThe DPP responder generates a key pair and sends the public key to the DPP initiator.\nThe DPP initiator generates a random number and sends it to the DPP responder.\nThe DPP responder derives a session key from the random number and the responder's private key.\nThe DPP initiator derives a session key from the random number and the initiator's private key.\nThe session key is used to encrypt communications between the DPP initiator and the DPP responder.\n\n3. Interaction with other components (if any) \n\nDPP interacts with the Wi-Fi driver to send and receive DPP messages.\nDPP also interacts with the Wi-Fi network manager to provision the device with Wi-Fi credentials.\n\n4. Important parameters and return values \n\nThe following parameters are important for DPP:\n \"public key\": The public key of the DPP responder.\n \"private key\": The private key of the DPP initiator.\n \"random number\": A random number generated by the DPP initiator.\n \"session key\": The session key derived from the random number and the private keys.\n\nThe following return values are important for DPP:\n RETURN_OK: The operation was successful.\n RETURN_ERR: The operation failed.\n\n5. Any specific RDK-related operations \n\nDPP is supported in RDK by the Wi-Fi HAL.\nThe Wi-Fi HAL provides a set of APIs that can be used to implement DPP.",
