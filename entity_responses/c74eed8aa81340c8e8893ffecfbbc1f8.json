  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n  * The primary purpose of the `WifiClient_ActiveMeasurements_GetParamBoolValue` function is to retrieve a Boolean value for a specific parameter related to Active Measurements in the Wi-Fi client. This parameter is typically an enable/disable flag controlling whether Active Measurements are enabled or not.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n  * The function takes several input parameters:\n    * `hInsContext`: An ANSC handle for the instance context of the Wi-Fi client.\n    * `ParamName`: The name of the parameter for which a Boolean value is requested, such as \"Enable\".\n    * `pBool`: A pointer to a Boolean variable where the retrieved value will be stored.\n  * The function first checks if the `ParamName` matches the expected parameter name, such as \"Enable\".\n  * If a match is found, it calls the internal function `CosaDmlWiFi_IsActiveMeasurementEnable()` to retrieve the current Boolean value for that parameter.\n  * Finally, the function sets the value of the `pBool` pointer to the retrieved Boolean value and returns TRUE if the parameter was successfully retrieved.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n  * The function may interact with other components within the CcspWifiAgent, such as the Wi-Fi driver or other modules responsible for managing Wi-Fi Active Measurements.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n  * Important parameters include:\n    * `ParamName`: The name of the parameter for which a Boolean value is requested.\n    * `pBool`: A pointer to a Boolean variable where the retrieved value will be stored.\n  * The function returns TRUE if the parameter value was successfully retrieved and FALSE otherwise.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n  * The function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component, which is responsible for managing Wi-Fi functionality in RDK devices.\n  * It specifically deals with Active Measurements, which are used for optimizing Wi-Fi performance and troubleshooting connectivity issues.",
