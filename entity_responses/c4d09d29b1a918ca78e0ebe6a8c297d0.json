  "response": "**1. Main Purpose and Functionality**\n\n`platform_hal_resetDscpCounts` is an RDK function that resets all the DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) counts for a specified WAN interface. DSCP is a 6-bit field in the IP header used to classify traffic and prioritize its forwarding. This function clears all the DSCP counts for the specified interface, allowing for a fresh start of tracking traffic patterns.\n\n**2. Key Operations and Data Flow**\n\nThe key operation of this function is to send a reset command to the hardware responsible for maintaining DSCP counts for the specified WAN interface. The function takes a single parameter, `interfaceType`, which specifies the WAN interface to be reset. The function then interacts with the hardware to perform the reset operation.\n\n**3. Interaction with Other Components**\n\nThis function interacts with the hardware responsible for maintaining DSCP counts for the specified WAN interface. It is likely that this hardware is managed by a separate driver or firmware module.\n\n**4. Important Parameters and Return Values**\n\n* **interfaceType (WAN_INTERFACE):** Specifies the WAN interface for which the DSCP counts should be reset. It can take values from the `WAN_INTERFACE` enum.\n* **Return Value (INT):** Returns `RETURN_OK` if the reset operation is successful, or `RETURN_ERR` if an error occurs.\n\n**5. Any Specific RDK-related Operations**\n\nThis function is part of the RDK HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) and is specific to RDK-based devices. It provides a standardized way to reset DSCP counts for WAN interfaces on RDK-compliant devices.",
