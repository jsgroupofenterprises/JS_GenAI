  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe CosaDmlWiFiApMfGetMacList function is used to retrieve the list of MAC addresses that are currently connected to the Wi-Fi access point (AP). The function takes as input a pointer to a buffer where the MAC addresses will be stored, a pointer to a string where the MAC addresses will be concatenated, and the number of MAC addresses to be retrieved. The function returns an ANSC_STATUS value indicating the success or failure of the operation.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function first iterates through the array of MAC addresses and converts each MAC address into a string. The string is then concatenated to the maclist string. The function returns ANSC_STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation is successful, or an error code if the operation fails.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe function does not interact with any other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following are the important parameters and return values of the function:\n\n* **mac:** A pointer to a buffer where the MAC addresses will be stored.\n* **maclist:** A pointer to a string where the MAC addresses will be concatenated.\n* **numList:** The number of MAC addresses to be retrieved.\n* **return value:** An ANSC_STATUS value indicating the success or failure of the operation.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
