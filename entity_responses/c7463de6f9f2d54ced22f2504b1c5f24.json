  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `cb_ovsdb_read_json` function is a callback function that is invoked when data is received from the OVSDB server. Its main purpose is to parse the received JSON data and extract the relevant information.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes a single parameter, which is a pointer to a buffer containing the received JSON data. It first checks if the buffer is full and, if so, resizes it to accommodate the new data. It then reads the data from the buffer and pads it with a null terminator to ensure that it is properly formatted.\n\nIt then parses the JSON data using a JSON parser and extracts the relevant information. This information is then passed to other components of the system for further processing.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe function interacts with the following components:\n\n* OVSDB server: The function receives data from the OVSDB server and parses it to extract the relevant information.\n* Other components of the system: The function passes the extracted information to other components of the system for further processing.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* **Input parameters:** The function takes a single input parameter, which is a pointer to a buffer containing the received JSON data.\n* **Return value:** The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the JSON data was parsed successfully.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe function is used by the CcspWifiAgent component of the RDK software platform. It is responsible for parsing the JSON data received from the OVSDB server and extracting the relevant information. This information is then used by the CcspWifiAgent component to manage the Wi-Fi network.",
