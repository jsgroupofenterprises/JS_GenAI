  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `wifi_dppProcessReconfigAuthResponse` function in the CcspWifiAgent component of RDK processes the Reconfigure Authentication Response received from a Wi-Fi device during the Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP) process. It validates the response, forwards it to the Wi-Fi driver to complete the DPP handshake, and sends a Reconfigure Authentication Confirmation message back to the device.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n* The function takes a pointer to a `wifi_device_dpp_context_t` structure as input, which contains the DPP context and relevant information.\n* It validates the Reconfigure Authentication Response from the device to ensure its integrity.\n* If the response is valid, it forwards the response to the Wi-Fi driver through a call to `wifi_dppSendReconfigAuthCnf`.\n* The Wi-Fi driver completes the DPP handshake based on the received response.\n* The function prints debug information related to the DPP process, if enabled.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\n* The function interacts with the Wi-Fi driver to complete the DPP handshake.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* **Parameters:**\n    * `dpp_ctx`: A pointer to a `wifi_device_dpp_context_t` structure containing the DPP context and relevant information.\n* **Return value:**\n    * The function returns an integer indicating the status of the operation.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThis function is part of the RDK Wi-Fi Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP) implementation, which allows Wi-Fi devices to be configured securely and easily using a QR code or NFC tag.",
