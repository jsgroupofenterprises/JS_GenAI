  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**:\n   - The 'set_ap_wps_ie' function in RDK's CcspWifiAgent component is responsible for updating the WPS IE (Wi-Fi Protected Setup Information Element) in the beacon, probe response, and association response frames transmitted by an Access Point (AP).\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n   - The function takes a pointer to a 'driver_data' structure ('priv'), along with buffers containing the beacon, probe response, and association response frames ('beacon', 'proberesp', and 'assocresp', respectively).\n   - It copies these buffers into internal 'wps_beacon_ie', 'wps_probe_resp_ie', and 'wpa_ie' variables, respectively, to update the AP's WPS IE.\n   - Subsequently, it calls the 'wifi_sethostApWpsIE' function multiple times to set the WPS IE for different frame types (beacon, probe response, and association response) on the AP.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components**:\n   - The 'wifi_sethostApWpsIE' function is defined elsewhere in the RDK codebase and likely interacts with the underlying Wi-Fi driver to set the WPS IE in the AP's frames.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n   - 'priv': Pointer to the driver_data structure containing information about the AP.\n   - 'beacon', 'proberesp', 'assocresp': Buffers containing the beacon, probe response, and association response frames, respectively.\n   - Return value: Indicates success (0) or failure (-1) in setting the WPS IE.\n\n5. **Specific RDK-related operations**:\n   - The 'wifi_sethostApWpsIE' function is specific to RDK and is responsible for setting the WPS IE on the host AP.",
