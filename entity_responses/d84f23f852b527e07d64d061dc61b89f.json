  "response": "## Analysis of `libhostapd_global_deinit()` Function\n\n### 1. Main purpose and functionality\n`libhostapd_global_deinit()` is a function in the CcspWifiAgent component responsible for deinitializing the global state of hostapd. It performs clean-up tasks for the drivers, EAP server, random number generator, and other global resources.\n\n### 2. Key operations and data flow\nThe function first iterates through the array of driver objects and calls the `global_deinit()` function for each non-null driver object. It then frees the memory allocated for the global driver private data and sets the global `drv_priv` pointer to `NULL`.\nSubsequently, it deinitializes the TNCS (EAP server) and the random number generator. The EAP server methods are also unregistered.\n\nThe function continues to remove the hostapd control interface socket file, close debugging files, and deinitialize the wifi callback mechanism.\n\n### 3. Interaction with other components (if any)\n- The function interacts with the driver objects to perform driver-specific global deinitialization tasks.\n- It interacts with the EAP server (TNCS) to deinitialize it.\n- It uses the `os_free()` function from the OS abstraction layer to free memory.\n\n### 4. Important parameters and return values\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\nThe function includes RDK-specific operations, such as:\n\n- Closing the RDK debug file using `rdk_debug_close_file()`.\n- Deinitializing the wifi callback using `wifi_callback_deinit()`.\nThese operations are specific to RDK's implementation and are not found in the standard hostapd codebase.",
