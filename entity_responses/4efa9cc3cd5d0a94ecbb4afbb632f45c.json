  "response": "## Analysis of s_sysevent_connect Function\n\n### 1. Main Purpose and Functionality\nThe `s_sysevent_connect` function establishes a connection with the RDK System Event Server (SES) and retrieves an authorization token. This token is used for subsequent interactions with the SES.\n\n### 2. Key Operations and Data Flow\n1. The function allocates memory for the `out_se_token` parameter, which will store the authorization token upon successful connection.\n2. It calls an internal function that connects to the SES using a predefined subsystem name (\"eRT.\").\n3. The connection process involves exchanging messages and authenticating with the SES.\n4. If the connection is successful, the authorization token is obtained and stored in the `out_se_token` parameter.\n\n### 3. Interaction with Other Components\nThe function interacts with the RDK System Event Server (SES) to establish a secure connection.\n\n### 4. Important Parameters and Return Values\n- **Parameters:**\n  - `out_se_token` (output): Pointer to store the authorization token.\n- **Return Value:**\n  - 0 on successful connection and token retrieval\n  - Negative error code on failure\n\n### 5. Specific RDK-Related Operations\nThe function relies on RDK-defined subsystem names for connecting to the SES. The function uses the \"eRT.\" subsystem to establish the connection.",
