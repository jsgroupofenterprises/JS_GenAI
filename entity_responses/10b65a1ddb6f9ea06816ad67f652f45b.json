  "response": "## Function Overview\nThis RDK function, `voice_hal_setVoiceProcessState`, is used to set the voice process state for a specified service and profile. It allows the CPE device to explicitly manage when the voice processing of a voice service is started or stopped.\n\n### Key Operations and Data Flow\n- The function takes a service ID and a voice process state as inputs.\n- It interacts with the TelcoVoIPAgent module to perform the requested voice process state changes.\n- The function sends a command to the TelcoVoIPAgent to start or stop the voice processing for the specified service and profile.\n\n### Interaction with Other Components\n- The TelcoVoIPAgent module is responsible for managing the voice processing and handling the SIP signaling for the voice service.\n\n### Important Parameters and Return Values\n- **service**: The ID of the voice service for which the voice process state needs to be changed.\n- **voice_state**: The desired voice process state, which can be VOICE_PROCESS_STATE_START, VOICE_PROCESS_STATE_STOP, or VOICE_PROCESS_STATE_RESTART.\n- **RDK_SUCCESS**: The function returns RDK_SUCCESS on success and RDK_FAILURE on error.\n\n### RDK-Related Operations\n- This function is part of the RDK Voice HAL API, which provides a standardized interface for managing voice services and profiles on RDK-based CPE devices. It allows applications and services to interact with the underlying voice processing and signaling functionality.",
