  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**:\n   - The `process_event()` function is the entry point for processing various Wi-Fi data plane events. \n   - It dispatches these events to appropriate submodules for further processing based on the event type.\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n   - The function takes a `wifi_data_plane_event_t` event and a `wifi_data_plane_t` `module` as input parameters.\n   - Based on the event type, it branches into different cases:\n     - For `\"wifi_data_plane_event_type_dpp\"` events, it calls `process_easy_connect_event()`, which handles Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP) events related to Wi-Fi Easy Connect.\n     - For `\"wifi_data_plane_event_type_anqp\"` events, it calls `process_passpoint_event()`, which handles Hotspot 2.0 (Passpoint) events.\n     - For other event types, it currently does not perform any specific processing.\n3. **Interaction with other components**:\n   - This function interacts with the following submodules:\n     - `module_easy_connect` for handling Wi-Fi Easy Connect DPP events.\n     - Passpoint-related components for processing Passpoint ANQP events.\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n   - `event`: Pointer to the received Wi-Fi data plane event.\n   - `module`: Pointer to the `wifi_data_plane_t` module instance.\n   - The function does not return any value (`void` return type).\n5. **Specific RDK-related operations**:\n   - This function is part of the RDK Centralized Wi-Fi (CcspWifiAgent) component. It handles Wi-Fi data plane events within the RDK-B environment.",
