  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `parse_cjson_object` function is responsible for converting a cJSON object into a message pack object.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\nThe function walks recursively through the cJSON object and encodes each element into a message pack object. For each element, it determines the type and packs it accordingly. For example, if the element is a string, it packs it as a message pack string, if it's a number, it packs it as a message pack number, and so on.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThe function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component and uses the `msgpack` library for packing objects.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n* `pk`: A pointer to the message pack packer object.\n* `node`: A pointer to the cJSON object to be packed.\n\nThe function returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThe function is not specific to RDK and can be used in any application that needs to convert a cJSON object to a message pack object.",
