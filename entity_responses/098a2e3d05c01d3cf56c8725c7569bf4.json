  "response": "## Function Analysis: rpc_update_handler_cmp\n\n### 1. Main purpose and functionality\nThe `rpc_update_handler_cmp` function is a comparison function used to sort a list of integers in ascending order. It is called by the qsort function in the `rpc_update_dns_handler` function in the CcspWifiAgent component of RDK.\n\n### 2. Key operations and data flow\nThe function takes two void pointers `a` and `b` and dereferences them to obtain two integers. It compares the two integers and returns -1 if the first integer is smaller, 1 if the first integer is larger, and 0 if the two integers are equal.\n\n### 3. Interaction with other components (if any)\nThe function is called by the qsort function in the `rpc_update_dns_handler` function, which is part of the CcspWifiAgent component in RDK.\n\n### 4. Important parameters and return values\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `a`: A void pointer to the first integer to be compared.\n  - `b`: A void pointer to the second integer to be compared.\n- **Return values**:\n  - -1 if the first integer is smaller.\n  - 1 if the first integer is larger.\n  - 0 if the two integers are equal.\n\n### 5. Any specific RDK-related operations\nThe function is used in the CcspWifiAgent component of RDK, which is responsible for managing Wi-Fi connections on RDK devices.",
