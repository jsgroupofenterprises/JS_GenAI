  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - This function is responsible for restoring the Passpoint Interworking settings on a particular access point (AP) specified by the input parameter `apIndex`.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow:**\n   - It first checks if the input `apIndex` is valid, and if not, it returns an error.\n   - If the index is valid, it retrieves the corresponding Access Point configuration structure (`pCfg`) from the internal data structures.\n   - It checks if Interworking is enabled on the AP, and if not, it returns success without performing any actions.\n   - If Interworking is enabled, it applies Interworking Element and Roaming Consortium Element configurations to the AP.\n   - Finally, it restores the Passpoint Enable status on the AP using the data stored in the global `g_interworking_data` array.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any):**\n   - This function interacts with the following components:\n     - The internal Passpoint data structures, which store Passpoint-related configurations.\n     - The wifi_passpoint_dbg_print function, which is used for debug logging.\n     - The enablePassPointSettings function, which is used to enable/disable Passpoint on the AP.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values:**\n   - **Parameters:**\n     - `apIndex`: The index of the AP for which Passpoint Interworking settings are being restored.\n   - **Return value:**\n     - `ANSC_STATUS_SUCCESS` if the operation was successful, otherwise an error code.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n   - This function is RDK-specific, as it uses RDK-defined data structures and functions to manage Passpoint settings on the AP.\n   - It interacts with the RDK's Passpoint implementation, which is based on the Hotspot 2.0 (HS2.0) standard.",
