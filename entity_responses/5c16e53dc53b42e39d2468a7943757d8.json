  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `is_matching_easy_connect_event` function checks if a given event matches a specified set of criteria related to an ongoing Wi-Fi Easy Connect session.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n- The function takes two parameters: a pointer to a `wifi_device_dpp_context_t` structure and a pointer to a `wifi_easy_connect_event_match_criteria_t` structure.\n- It compares the `ap_index` and `sta_mac` fields of the `wifi_device_dpp_context_t` structure with the corresponding fields in the `wifi_easy_connect_event_match_criteria_t` structure.\n- It also compares the `state` field of the `wifi_device_dpp_context_t` structure with the `state` field in the `wifi_easy_connect_event_match_criteria_t` structure.\n- If all of the comparisons are true, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThis function is typically called by other components within the CcspWifiAgent component.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n- `ctx`: A pointer to a `wifi_device_dpp_context_t` structure that contains information about the ongoing Wi-Fi Easy Connect session.\n- `ptr`: A pointer to a `wifi_easy_connect_event_match_criteria_t` structure that contains the criteria to match against the event.\n- Return value: A boolean value indicating whether the event matches the specified criteria.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThis function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component, which is an RDK component that provides Wi-Fi connectivity management and configuration functionality.",
