  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `ovsdb_table_select_one` function selects and retrieves a single row from an OVSDB table based on a specified column-value pair. It provides a simple way to query the table for a specific record.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n* The function takes as input the OVSDB socket path, the table to query, the column name, the value to match, and a pointer to an empty record structure.\n* It connects to the OVSDB server using the provided socket path.\n* It constructs an OVSDB transaction with a select operation to retrieve all rows from the specified table where the specified column matches the specified value.\n* It sends the transaction to the server and waits for the response.\n* The response contains the matching row, if any.\n* The function populates the provided record structure with the data from the matching row.\n* It returns `true` if a matching row was found and `false` otherwise.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe function interacts with the OVSDB server to retrieve the data. It does not directly interact with other RDK components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* `ovsdb_sock_path`: The path to the OVSDB socket.\n* `table`: The OVSDB table to query.\n* `column`: The name of the column to match.\n* `value`: The value to match.\n* `record`: A pointer to an empty record structure to be populated with the matching row data.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations. It can be used to query any OVSDB table, regardless of its RDK-specific purpose.",
