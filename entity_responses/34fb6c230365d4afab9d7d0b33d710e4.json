  "response": "**1. Main Purpose and Functionality**\n\nThe `socket_set_keepalive` function configures keepalive options for a socket `fd` to maintain a persistent connection by sending keepalive probes periodically.\n\n**2. Key Operations and Data Flow**\n\n* Sets the `TCP_KEEPIDLE` option to specify the idle time before sending the first keepalive probe.\n* Sets the `TCP_KEEPINTVL` option to define the interval between keepalive probes.\n* Sets the `TCP_KEEPCNT` option to determine the number of unanswered probes before the connection is terminated.\n* Finally, sets the `SO_KEEPALIVE` option to enable keepalive probes.\n\n**3. Interaction with Other Components (if any)**\n\nThis function is isolated to socket operations and does not interact with other components.\n\n**4. Important Parameters and Return Values**\n\n* **Parameters**:\n    * `fd`: File descriptor of the socket to configure.\n* **Return Value**:\n    * `bool`: True if all keepalive options are set successfully, false if any option fails.\n\n**5. Specific RDK-related Operations**\n\nThis function does not perform any RDK-specific operations. It's a generic socket configuration function for maintaining persistent socket connections.",
