  "response": "**1. Main Purpose and Functionality:**\n\n`deinit_lib_hostapd()` is a function in CcspWifiAgent that deinitializes the libhostapd or hapd library for the specified access point (AP) index. It is used to release resources and clean up the hostapd library when an AP is disabled or removed.\n\n**2. Key Operations and Data Flow:**\n\n* **Input:** Receives an `ap_index` parameter, which specifies the index of the AP for which deinitialization is requested.\n* **Process:** Based on the product requirements, it either calls `libhostapd_wpa_deinit()` or `hapd_wpa_deinit()` to deinitialize the hostapd library for the given AP.\n* **Output:** Returns `0` on success or a negative error code indicating failure.\n\n**3. Interaction with Other Components (if any):**\n\n* **CcspWifiAgent:** The calling component that initiates the deinitialization process for the hostapd library.\n\n**4. Important Parameters and Return Values:**\n\n* **`ap_index`:** Index of the AP for which deinitialization is requested.\n* **Return Value:**\n    * `0`: Deinitialization successful.\n    * Negative error code: Deinitialization failed.\n\n**5. Any Specific RDK-Related Operations:**\n\n* The function name and the usage of `libhostapd_wpa_deinit()` in the XB7 product line are specific to the RDK environment.",
