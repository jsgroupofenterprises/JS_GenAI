  "response": "## Analysis of ovsdb_get_insert_result_uuid Function\n\n### 1. Main Purpose and Functionality\n\nThis function in CcspWifiAgent library extracts the UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) from an OVSDB (Open vSwitch Database) insert operation result. It parses the JSON response from OVSDB to retrieve the UUID assigned to the inserted row.\n\n### 2. Key Operations and Data Flow\n\n- Parses the input JSON result to ensure it's an array.\n- Iterates through the array to find the first non-empty object.\n- Checks for error or missing UUID fields in the found object.\n- Extracts the UUID from the \"uuid\" field and stores it in the provided `uuid` parameter.\n\n### 3. Interaction with Other Components\n\nThis function interacts with the OVSDB database to retrieve the insert operation result.\n\n### 4. Important Parameters and Return Values\n\n- `result`: JSON array containing the OVSDB insert operation result.\n- `table`: Name of the OVSDB table where the operation was performed.\n- `oper`: String indicating the operation type (in this case, \"insert\").\n- `uuid` (optional): Pointer to an `ovs_uuid_t` structure to store the extracted UUID.\n- Return value: Boolean indicating success or failure of UUID retrieval.\n\n### 5. RDK-Related Operations\n\nThis function is specifically designed to work with OVSDB, which is a key component of RDK (Reference Design Kit) for set-top boxes and other connected devices. It enables communication between various RDK components and allows for configuration and management of device functionality.",
