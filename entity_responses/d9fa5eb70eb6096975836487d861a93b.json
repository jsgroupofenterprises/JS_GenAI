  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `hal_ipc_callback_func` function is the callback function for processing IPC (Inter-Process Communication) messages from the Wifi HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer). It is designed to handle various IPC commands related to Wi-Fi configuration and operations.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes two parameters: a pointer to a `wifi_hal_ipc_data_t` structure containing the IPC message data and a boolean flag `is_ipc` indicating whether the message was received via IPC or another mechanism. The function then switches on the `wifi_hal_cmd_t` command contained in the IPC message and performs the appropriate operation based on the command.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe function interacts with the TR-181 IPC configuration mechanism to update the relevant settings in the TR-181 data model. It also interacts with the Wifi HAL to perform the requested operations.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* **Parameters:**\n    * `data`: Pointer to the `wifi_hal_ipc_data_t` structure containing the IPC message data.\n    * `is_ipc`: Boolean flag indicating whether the message was received via IPC or another mechanism.\n* **Return value:**\n    * The function returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe function handles RDK-specific IPC commands such as:\n    * `wifi_hal_cmd_bss_transition`: Update BSS transition activation state.\n    * `wifi_hal_cmd_interworking`: Add Interworking IE to the beacon.\n    * `wifi_hal_cmd_greylisting`: Enable or disable greylist access control.\n    * `wifi_hal_cmd_mesh_reconfig`: Update LibHostApdConfig for mesh configuration.\n    * `wifi_hal_cmd_start_stop_hostapd`: Start or stop the hostapd process.",
