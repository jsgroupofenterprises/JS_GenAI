  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe deviceDisonnectHandler function is a callback function that handles the \"Device.WiFi.AccessPoint.{vap}.X_RDK_deviceDisconnected\" event, which is triggered when a device disconnects from a Wi-Fi access point (vap). The function parses the event data to extract the MAC address of the disconnected device and the vap from which it disconnected, and then prints a debug message to the console.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe key operations and data flow in the deviceDisonnectHandler function are as follows:\n\n1. The function checks if the event object is valid and if the event name matches the expected format. If either of these checks fails, the function returns without taking any further action.\n2. The function retrieves the value associated with the event name from the event data.\n3. The function parses the value to extract the MAC address of the disconnected device and the vap from which it disconnected.\n4. The function prints a debug message to the console, containing the MAC address of the disconnected device and the vap from which it disconnected.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe deviceDisonnectHandler function does not interact with any other components directly. However, it may indirectly interact with other components by printing debug messages to the console, which can be consumed by other components that are monitoring the console.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following are the important parameters and return values of the deviceDisonnectHandler function:\n\n* **handle:** The handle of the Rbus service.\n* **event:** The event object that triggered the callback.\n* **subscription:** The subscription object that was used to subscribe to the event.\n* **Return value:** The function has no return value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe deviceDisonnectHandler function uses the following RDK-specific operations:\n\n* **rbusObject_GetValue():** This function retrieves the value associated with a given key from an Rbus object.\n* **rbusValue_GetBytes():** This function retrieves the bytes associated with an Rbus value.",
