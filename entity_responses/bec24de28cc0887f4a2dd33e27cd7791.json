  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `setWiFiBlobVersion` function is used to set the version of the WiFi blob in the Persistent Storage Manager (PSM) database. The WiFi blob is a binary file that contains the configuration settings for the WiFi network. The version number is used to track changes to the blob, such as when a new setting is added or modified.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n* `subdoc`: The sub-document path where the version number should be set.\n* `version`: The version number to set.\n\nThe function first creates a string containing the version number and another string containing the path to the sub-document where the version number should be set. It then calls `PSM_Set_Record_Value2` to set the value of the sub-document to the version number string.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThe `setWiFiBlobVersion` function interacts with the PSM, which is a component that stores configuration settings for devices.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\nThe important parameters of the `setWiFiBlobVersion` function are:\n\n* `subdoc`: The sub-document path where the version number should be set.\n* `version`: The version number to set.\n\nThe function returns `RETURN_OK` if the version number is successfully set, or `RETURN_ERR` if there is an error.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThe `setWiFiBlobVersion` function uses the PSM, which is an RDK-specific component.",
