  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe platform_hal_GetSoftwareVersion function is used to retrieve the software version of the device. The software version is a vendor-specific value that identifies the version of the software installed on the device.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n* `pValue`: A pointer to a buffer where the software version will be stored.\n* `maxSize`: The size of the buffer in bytes.\n\nThe function copies the software version into the buffer specified by `pValue` and returns the length of the software version in bytes. If the buffer size is too small to hold the software version, the function will return an error.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThis function does not interact with any other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following parameters and return values are important:\n\n* `pValue`: The buffer where the software version will be stored.\n* `maxSize`: The size of the buffer in bytes.\n* `RETURN_OK`: The function was successful.\n* `RETURN_ERR`: An error occurred.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThis function is not specific to RDK. It can be used on any device that supports the HAL API.",
