  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - The `events_GetHandler` function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component and is used to set up a callback handler for receiving events from the RDK platform.\n   - The function takes in a property to specify which event to listen for, and an options parameter to configure the behavior of the handler.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow:**\n   - The function first checks if the RDK platform is available, and if it is not, it returns an error.\n   - If the RDK platform is available, the function creates a new RDK bus handle and a queue to store incoming events.\n   - The function then registers a callback handler with the RDK platform, specifying the queue to store incoming events in.\n   - When an event is received from the RDK platform, it is stored in the queue.\n   - The callback handler is then called to process the event.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components:**\n   - The `events_GetHandler` function interacts with the following components:\n     - RDK platform: The function uses the RDK platform to register a callback handler for receiving events.\n     - CcspWifiAgent: The function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component, which is responsible for managing Wi-Fi connections.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values:**\n   - **Parameters:**\n     - `handle`: The RDK bus handle.\n     - `property`: The property to listen for events on.\n     - `opts`: The options to configure the behavior of the handler.\n   - **Return values:**\n     - `rbusError_t`: The status of the operation.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n   - The `events_GetHandler` function uses the following RDK-related operations:\n     - `rbus_createHandle`: Creates a new RDK bus handle.\n     - `rbus_registerHandler`: Registers a callback handler with the RDK platform.",
