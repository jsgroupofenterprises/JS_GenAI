  "response": "**1. Purpose of this structure**\n\nThe `wifi_InterworkingElement_t` structure is used to represent the Interworking Element (IE) information associated with a Wi-Fi network. The IE is a set of attributes that are included in the Beacon and Probe Response frames of a Wi-Fi network, and provide information about the network's capabilities and configuration.\n\n**2. Key fields and their significance**\n\n* `interworkingEnabled`: This field indicates whether or not interworking is enabled for the network. Interworking allows devices to connect to different networks seamlessly, such as between a Wi-Fi network and a cellular network.\n* `accessNetworkType`: This field indicates the type of access network that the device is connected to. This information is used to determine the appropriate security and authentication mechanisms to use.\n* `internetAvailable`: This field indicates whether or not the network has access to the Internet. This information is used to determine whether or not to allow devices to connect to the network.\n* `asra`: This field indicates whether or not the network supports Automatic System Roaming (ASRA). ASRA allows devices to automatically roam between different networks without having to manually re-authenticate.\n* `esr`: This field indicates whether or not the network supports Enhanced System Roaming (ESR). ESR provides additional features and capabilities over ASRA, such as support for multiple roaming partners.\n* `uesa`: This field indicates whether or not the network supports Unequal Security Authorization (UESA). UESA allows devices to connect to a network using different security credentials.\n* `venueOptionPresent`: This field indicates whether or not the venue information has been provided for the network. Venue information includes details about the location of the network, such as the name and address of the establishment.\n* `venueGroup`: This field indicates the venue group for the network. The venue group is a categorization of the venue based on its type, such as a home, office, or public hotspot.\n* `venueType`: This field indicates the venue type for the network. The venue type is a more specific categorization of the venue, such as a coffee shop, library, or airport.\n* `hessOptionPresent`: This field indicates whether or not the HESSID (Home Extended Subnet ID) has been provided for the network. The HESSID is an optional identifier that can be used to identify a specific BSS (Basic Service Set) within a larger ESS (Extended Service Set).\n* `hessid`: This field contains the HESSID for the network.\n\n**3. Usage context in RDK**\n\nThe `wifi_InterworkingElement_t` structure is used by the RDK Wi-Fi components to manage and configure Wi-Fi networks. The structure is used to store the IE information for each network, and this information is used to determine the appropriate security and authentication mechanisms to use, and to provide information about the network's capabilities and configuration to devices.\n\n**4. Related components or interfaces**\n\nThe `wifi_InterworkingElement_t` structure is used by the following components or interfaces:\n\n* `wifi_hal_api.h`: This header file defines the API functions for managing and configuring Wi-Fi networks. The API functions use the `wifi_InterworkingElement_t` structure to store and retrieve the IE information for each network.\n* `wifi_hal_impl.c`: This file contains the implementation of the API functions for managing and configuring Wi-Fi networks. The implementation uses the `wifi_InterworkingElement_t` structure to store and retrieve the IE information for each network.\n* `wifi_hal_event.h`: This header file defines the event types that are used to notify applications of changes to the Wi-Fi network configuration. The `wifi_hal_event_t` event type includes the `wifi_InterworkingElement_t` structure as a parameter, which contains the updated IE information for the network.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related details**\n\nThe `wifi_InterworkingElement_t` structure is a part of the RDK Wi-Fi HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer). The HAL provides a common interface for managing and configuring Wi-Fi networks, and is used by the RDK Wi-Fi components to communicate with the underlying hardware.",
