  "response": "**1. Purpose of this structure**\n\nThe `moca_mac_counters_t` structure is used to store statistics related to the operation of the Media Oriented Communications Alliance (MoCA) MAC layer. These statistics can be used to monitor the performance of the MAC layer and to troubleshoot any problems that may occur.\n\n**2. Key fields and their significance**\n\nThe key fields in the `moca_mac_counters_t` structure are:\n\n* `Map`: Number of MAP packets\n* `Rsrv`: Number of Reservation Request Packets\n* `Lc`: Number of Link Control Packets\n* `Adm`: Number of Admission Request Packets\n* `Probe`: Number of Probes\n* `Async`: Number of Beacons\n\nThese fields represent the number of packets of each type that have been transmitted or received by the MAC layer.\n\n**3. Usage context in RDK**\n\nThe `moca_mac_counters_t` structure is used in the RDK HAL component to store statistics related to the operation of the MoCA MAC layer. These statistics can be used to monitor the performance of the MAC layer and to troubleshoot any problems that may occur.\n\n**4. Related components or interfaces**\n\nThe `moca_mac_counters_t` structure is used by the following components or interfaces:\n\n* **RDK HAL:** The RDK HAL component provides an interface to the MoCA MAC layer. The `moca_mac_counters_t` structure is used to store statistics related to the operation of the MAC layer.\n* **MoCA MAC driver:** The MoCA MAC driver is responsible for implementing the MAC layer. The driver uses the `moca_mac_counters_t` structure to store statistics related to the operation of the MAC layer.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related details**\n\nThe `moca_mac_counters_t` structure is specific to RDK and is not used in other contexts.",
