  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `os_nif_softwds_create` function is designed to create a Soft Wireless Distribution System (SoftWDS) link using the Linux kernel's SoftWDS capabilities. The main purpose is to set up a wireless network connection with the specified SoftWDS link.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes four parameters:\n\n* `ifname`: The name of the SoftWDS interface to be created.\n* `parent`: The name of the parent interface to which the SoftWDS link will be attached.\n* `mac`: The MAC address to be assigned to the SoftWDS interface.\n* `wrap`: A flag indicating whether the SoftWDS link should be wrapped in a VLAN.\n\nThe function first constructs a command string using the given parameters. The command includes the `ip link add` command to create the SoftWDS link, the `echo` command to set the MAC address, and the `echo` command to set the wrap flag.\n\nThe function then executes the command using the `cmd_log` function. If the command is successful, the function returns `true`, indicating that the SoftWDS link was created and configured successfully. Otherwise, the function returns `false`, and an error message is logged.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `os_nif_softwds_create` function interacts with the Linux kernel's SoftWDS capabilities to create and configure the SoftWDS link.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* **Parameters:**\n\n    * `ifname`: The name of the SoftWDS interface to be created.\n    * `parent`: The name of the parent interface to which the SoftWDS link will be attached.\n    * `mac`: The MAC address to be assigned to the SoftWDS interface.\n    * `wrap`: A flag indicating whether the SoftWDS link should be wrapped in a VLAN.\n\n* **Return values:**\n\n    * `true` if the SoftWDS link was created and configured successfully.\n    * `false` if the SoftWDS link could not be created or configured.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `os_nif_softwds_create` function is part of the RDK's CcspWifiAgent component. The CcspWifiAgent component is responsible for managing the wireless network functionality of RDK devices.",
