  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `free_str_tree` function is responsible for freeing a binary search tree of string pairs (`ds_tree_t`). It iterates through the tree, removes each node, and frees the node's memory.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n- The function takes a pointer to a `ds_tree_t` as input.\n- It initializes two pointers: `to_remove` and `pair`.\n- The function enters a while loop that continues until `pair` is NULL.\n- Inside the loop, it assigns the current value of `pair` to `to_remove`.\n- It then sets `pair` to the next element in the tree.\n- It removes `to_remove` from the tree.\n- The memory pointed to by `to_remove` is freed.\n- The while loop continues until all elements have been removed from the tree.\n- After the while loop, the memory pointed to by `tree` is freed.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThis function does not directly interact with other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `tree`: A pointer to the root of a binary search tree of string pairs.\n- **Return value**: None.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThis function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
