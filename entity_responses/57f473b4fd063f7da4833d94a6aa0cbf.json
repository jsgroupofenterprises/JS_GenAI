  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `start_device_provisioning` function:\n\n- **Purpose:** Initiates the Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP) process on a device. DPP allows devices to securely establish a Wi-Fi connection without sharing passwords.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n- Creates a `wifi_device_dpp_context_t` structure to hold DPP-related information.\n- Populates the context with data from the provided `PCOSA_DML_WIFI_AP` and `PCOSA_DML_WIFI_DPP_STA_CFG` structures.\n- Sets the initial state of the DPP session to `STATE_DPP_UNPROVISIONED`.\n- Pushes the context into a data plane event queue.\n- Starts a thread to handle the DPP activation process.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\n- Interacts with the DPP library to perform DPP operations.\n- Data plane event queue is used to handle asynchronous events related to DPP activation.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n- **Parameters:**\n  - `PCOSA_DML_WIFI_AP pWiFiAP` - Pointer to the Wi-Fi access point configuration.\n  - `ULONG staIndex` - Index of the station to be provisioned.\n- **Return values:**\n  - `RETURN_OK` - If DPP activation is started successfully.\n  - `RETURN_ERR` - If there are errors during DPP activation.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\n- Uses the `data_plane_queue_push` function provided by the RDK Data Plane Framework.",
