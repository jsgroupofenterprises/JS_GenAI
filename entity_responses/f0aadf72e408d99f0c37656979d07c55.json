  "response": "## 1. Main purpose and functionality\n\nThis is a function in the RDK Voice HAL library that gets the hold mode inactive status of a voice service.\n\n## 2. Key operations and data flow\n\nThe function takes three input parameters:\n- `service`: The voice service for which the hold mode inactive status is requested.\n- `profile`: The voice profile for which the hold mode inactive status is requested.\n- `enable`: A pointer to a boolean variable that will be set to `true` if the hold mode is inactive, or `false` otherwise.\n\nThe function returns an integer status code indicating the success or failure of the operation. If the operation is successful, the value of the `enable` parameter will be set to the hold mode inactive status.\n\n## 3. Interaction with other components (if any)\n\nThis function interacts with the Voice Service Manager (VSM) to get the hold mode inactive status of a voice service.\n\n## 4. Important parameters and return values\n\n- `service`: The voice service for which the hold mode inactive status is requested.\n- `profile`: The voice profile for which the hold mode inactive status is requested.\n- `enable`: A pointer to a boolean variable that will be set to `true` if the hold mode is inactive, or `false` otherwise.\n- `RDK_SUCCESS`: The operation was successful.\n- `RDK_FAILURE`: The operation failed.\n\n## 5. Any specific RDK-related operations\n\nThis function is part of the RDK Voice HAL library, which provides a set of interfaces for interacting with the VSM.",
