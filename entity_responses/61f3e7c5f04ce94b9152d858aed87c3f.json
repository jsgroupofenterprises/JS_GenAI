  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe CosaLoggingInitialize function is responsible for initializing the logging component in the CcspWifiAgent module. It allocates memory for the logging object and its configuration, and retrieves the logging configuration from the system.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\nThe function first allocates memory for the logging object and its configuration. If any of these allocations fail, the function returns an error status.\n\nNext, the function calls the CosaDmlLogging_GetConfiguration function to retrieve the logging configuration from the system. This configuration includes settings such as the logging level, the maximum size of log files, and the number of log files to retain.\n\nFinally, the function assigns the allocated address of the logging configuration to the logging object and sets the logging object pointer in the passed-in handle.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThe CosaLoggingInitialize function interacts with the CosaDmlLogging component to retrieve the logging configuration from the system.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\nThe function takes the following parameters:\n\n* hThisObject: A handle to the logging object.\n\nThe function returns the following status codes:\n\n* ANSC_STATUS_SUCCESS: The function executed successfully.\n* ANSC_STATUS_RESOURCES: The function failed to allocate memory for the logging object or its configuration.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThe CosaLoggingInitialize function is an RDK-specific function that is used to initialize the logging component in the CcspWifiAgent module. It is not used in other RDK components.",
