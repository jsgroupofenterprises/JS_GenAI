  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\n- The `wifi_receivedDataFrame_callback` is a callback that is called when a data frame is received in HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)\n- The callback is registered using the `wifi_frameDataCallback_register` function.\n- The callback is executed with the following arguments:\n    - apIndex: The index of the VAP on which the frame was received.\n    - sta_mac: The MAC address of the station that sent the frame.\n    - frame: A pointer to the frame data.\n    - len: The length of the frame data.\n    - type: The type of the frame.\n    - dir: The direction of the frame (transmit or receive).\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n- The data flow for the callback is as follows:\n    - The HAL receives a data frame.\n    - The HAL calls the callback function.\n    - The callback function processes the frame data.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\n- The callback can interact with other components via the frame data argument. \n- The callback can use the frame data to update the state of the application or to send the data to another component.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n- The following parameters are important:\n    - apIndex: The index of the VAP on which the frame was received.\n    - sta_mac: The MAC address of the station that sent the frame.\n    - frame: A pointer to the frame data.\n    - len: The length of the frame data.\n    - type: The type of the frame.\n    - dir: The direction of the frame (transmit or receive).\n- The callback function should return an INT value. The return value is not used by the HAL.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\n- This callback is used by RDK applications to process data frames that are received in HAL.",
