  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe purpose of `CosaDmlWiFi_GetGoodRssiThresholdValue` function is to get the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) threshold value for determining whether a wireless signal is considered good. A good RSSI value indicates that the signal strength is strong enough to provide a reliable connection.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n* The function takes a pointer to an integer variable `rssi` as its input parameter.\n* The function assigns the value of -65 to the variable pointed to by `rssi`. This value represents the RSSI threshold below which the signal is considered weak.\n* The function returns the status code `ANSC_STATUS_SUCCESS` to indicate that the operation was successful.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThis function does not directly interact with any other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n| Parameter | Data Type | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `rssi` | Pointer to an integer | Pointer to a variable to receive the RSSI threshold value |\n| Return value | Integer | Status code indicating the success or failure of the operation |\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThis function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component within the RDK software stack. It is used by other components in the stack to determine whether a wireless signal is strong enough to provide a good connection.",
