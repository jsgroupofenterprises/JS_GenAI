  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `ovsdb_process_result` function is a callback function used to process the result of an OVSDB RPC request.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n* The function takes two parameters:\n    * `id`: A unique identifier for the RPC request.\n    * `js`: The JSON response from the OVSDB server.\n\n* The function first checks if the response is an error message by calling the `ovsdb_process_error` function.\n* If the response is not an error message, the function calls the `ovsdb_process_update` function to process the update.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\n* The `ovsdb_process_result` function is called from the `ovsdb_rpc_callback` function, which is the callback function for all OVSDB RPC requests.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n* The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the result was processed successfully.\n* If the result was processed successfully, the function also updates the state of the local OVSDB database.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\n* The `ovsdb_process_result` function is used to process the result of OVSDB RPC requests that are made by the CcspWifiAgent component of the RDK.",
