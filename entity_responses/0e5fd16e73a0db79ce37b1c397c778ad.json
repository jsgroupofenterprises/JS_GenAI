  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - The `time_monotonic` function is used to get the current time in seconds since the system boot. It returns a time_t value representing the number of seconds since the system boot.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n   - The function calls the clock_gettime system call to get the current time using the CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock.\n   - The CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock is a monotonic clock that always increases, even if the system time is changed.\n   - The function then returns the seconds field of the timespec structure returned by clock_gettime.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n   - The function does not interact with any other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n   - The function does not take any parameters.\n   - The function returns a time_t value representing the number of seconds since the system boot.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n   - The function does not perform any RDK-specific operations. It is a generic function that can be used in any C or C++ program.**",
