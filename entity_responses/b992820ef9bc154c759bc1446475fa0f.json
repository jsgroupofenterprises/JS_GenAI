  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `stream_client_msmt_data` function in CcspWifiAgent is responsible for collecting and uploading client measurement data to the RDK cloud. It is used for both active and passive measurement scenarios.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n* The function first retrieves the necessary data structures, including the Wi-Fi monitor, active measurement data, and hash map of STA data.\n* The function then switches between active and passive measurement modes to obtain the indices and data for the corresponding STA.\n* If in active measurement mode, the data is uploaded using `upload_single_client_active_msmt_data`, otherwise it uses `upload_single_client_msmt_data`.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe function interacts with the following components:\n\n* The Wi-Fi monitor (wifi_monitor_t) provides the necessary context for both active and passive measurement scenarios.\n* The active measurement data (wifi_actvie_msmt_t) provides the information for active measurement scenarios.\n* The hash map of STA data (sta_map) is used to retrieve the STA data for the specified MAC address.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* The function takes one parameter, `ActiveMsmtFlag`, which indicates whether the function is being called for active or passive measurement.\n* The function does not return any value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe function uses the following RDK-related functions:\n\n* `get_wifi_monitor()`: Retrieves the Wi-Fi monitor instance.\n* `get_active_msmt_data()`: Retrieves the active measurement data.\n* `hash_map_get()`: Retrieves the STA data for the specified MAC address from the hash map.\n* `upload_single_client_msmt_data()`: Uploads single client measurement data to the RDK cloud.\n* `upload_single_client_active_msmt_data()`: Uploads single client active measurement data to the RDK cloud.",
