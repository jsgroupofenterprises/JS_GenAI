  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\nThe `printBlastMetricData` function is used to debug and print Blast metrics for a specific client.\nIt prints information about the active plan ID, step ID, radio metrics, operating channel metrics, and client Blast metrics.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n- The function takes the following parameters:\n    - `msmtType`: The type of measurement being taken, either `SINGLE_CLIENT_MSMT` or `MULTI_CLIENT_MSMT`.\n    - `monRadio`: A pointer to the `wifi_monitor_t` structure containing the monitor data for the radio.\n    - `staData`: A pointer to the `sta_data_t` structure containing the client data.\n    - `monitor`: A pointer to the `wifi_actvie_msmt_t` structure containing the active measurement data.\n    - `activeClient`: A boolean indicating whether the client is active.\n    - `callerFunc`: The name of the calling function.\n- The function first checks if the input pointers are valid.\n- If the pointers are valid, the function prints the following information:\n    - The active plan ID and step ID.\n    - The radio metrics for all radios, including the noise floor, channel utilization, radio activity factor, carrier sense threshold exceeded, and channels in use.\n    - The operating channel metrics, including the operating standard, operating channel, operating channel bandwidth, and frequency band.\n    - The client Blast metrics, including the MAC address, TX retransmissions, max TX rate, signal strength, SNR, TX PHY rate, RX PHY rate, and throughput.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\nThe `printBlastMetricData` function interacts with the following components:\n- The WiFi Monitor component, which provides the radio and client data.\n- The Active Measurement component, which provides the active measurement data.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\nThe `printBlastMetricData` function does not return any values.\nThe following parameters are important:\n- `msmtType`: The type of measurement being taken.\n- `monRadio`: A pointer to the `wifi_monitor_t` structure containing the monitor data for the radio.\n- `staData`: A pointer to the `sta_data_t` structure containing the client data.\n- `monitor`: A pointer to the `wifi_actvie_msmt_t` structure containing the active measurement data.\n- `activeClient`: A boolean indicating whether the client is active.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\nThe `printBlastMetricData` function uses the following RDK-specific operations:\n- `CcspWifiTrace()`: A macro used to print debug messages.\n- `CcspTraceError()`: A macro used to print error messages.",
