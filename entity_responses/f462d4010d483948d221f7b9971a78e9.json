  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `COSA_Async_Init` function in `CcspWifiAgent` is responsible for initializing the async operations for the component. It sets up the necessary data structures and does some initial configuration.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function first checks if the global `g_pCosaBEManager` variable is set. If it is not, it returns -1 to indicate that the initialization failed.\n\nIf `g_pCosaBEManager` is set, the function proceeds to do some additional initialization, including:\n\n- Acquiring a handle to the `COSAGetLPCRole` function using the `AcquireFunction` method of the `PCOSA_PLUGIN_INFO` object passed in as a parameter.\n- Calling the `COSAGetLPCRole` function to get the current role of the device.\n- Based on the role of the device, it either removes and recreates the Wi-Fi or MoCA data model objects.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe function interacts with the following other components:\n\n- `CosaWifiCreate`: This function is used to create a new Wi-Fi data model object.\n- `CosaMoCACreate`: This function is used to create a new MoCA data model object.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**\n\n- `uMaxVersionSupported`: This parameter specifies the maximum version of the RDK API that the caller supports. It is not used by the function.\n- `hCosaPlugInfo`: This parameter is a pointer to a `PCOSA_PLUGIN_INFO` object. It contains various information about the caller, including the handle to the `COSAGetLPCRole` function.\n- Return value: The function returns 0 on success or -1 on failure.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe function uses the RDK-specific `COSAGetLPCRole` function to determine the role of the device.",
