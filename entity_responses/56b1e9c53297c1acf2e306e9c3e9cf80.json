  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\n* The main purpose of 'anqpRequest_callback' is to receive and process an ANQP (Access Network Query Protocol) request from an STA (Station). \n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n* When an ANQP request is received, this callback function allocates memory for a 'cosa_wifi_anqp_context_t' structure, which represents the ANQP request context.\n* It populates the ANQP request context with information such as the access point index, the source station's MAC address, the ANQP request token, and the head of the list of ANQP elements received in the request.\n* It then prepares an event using the data_plane_queue_create_event() function and pushes it into the data plane queue using the data_plane_queue_push() function.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components:**\n\n* The data plane queue is responsible for processing the ANQP request event and sending it to the appropriate RDK components for further handling.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n* **apIndex:** Index of the access point that received the ANQP request.\n* **sta:** MAC address of the station that sent the ANQP request.\n* **token:** ANQP request token.\n* **head:** Head of the list of ANQP elements received in the request.\n* The function returns void.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\n* The function interacts with the RDK data plane queue component to forward the ANQP request event for processing by the appropriate RDK components.",
