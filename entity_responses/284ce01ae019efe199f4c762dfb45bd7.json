  "response": "## Function Overview\nThe `INT` function `CcspHalExtSw_ethAssociatedDevice_callback` is a callback registration function that allows you to register a callback function that will be invoked when an Ethernet-associated device is detected.\n\n## Parameters\nThe function takes one parameter:\n - `callback_proc`: A pointer to a callback function that takes a single parameter of type `eth_device_t`. The `eth_device_t` structure contains information about the associated device, including its MAC address, port, VLAN ID, Tx and Rx rates, and whether it is active.\n\n## Return Value\nThe function returns an `INT` value indicating the status of the operation:\n - `RETURN_OK` if successful\n - `RETURN_ERR` if any error is detected or the MAC address is not found\n\n## Key Operations and Data Flow\nThe key operations and data flow of the function are as follows:\n\n1. The function registers the specified callback function with the system.\n2. When an Ethernet-associated device is detected, the system invokes the registered callback function.\n\n## Interaction with Other Components\nThe function interacts with other components of the system, such as the Ethernet driver and the network management system.\n\n## Important Parameters and Return Values\nThe following parameters and return values are important to note:\n- `callback_proc`: The callback function that is registered with the system. This function is invoked when an Ethernet-associated device is detected.\n- `eth_device_t`: The structure that contains information about the associated device.\n- `RETURN_OK`: Indicates that the operation was successful.\n- `RETURN_ERR`: Indicates that an error occurred during the operation.\n\n## Specific RDK-Related Operations\nThe function is part of the RDK Broadband Home Gateway (BHG) software stack. It is used to manage Ethernet-associated devices on the BHG.",
