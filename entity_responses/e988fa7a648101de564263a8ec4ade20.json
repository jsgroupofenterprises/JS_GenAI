  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**:\n   - The `rpc_response_handler_cmp` function is a comparison function used to sort a list of integers in ascending order.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n   - The function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are both pointers to integers.\n   - It compares the values of the integers pointed to by `a` and `b`.\n   - If the value of the integer pointed to by `a` is less than the value of the integer pointed to by `b`, the function returns -1.\n   - If the value of the integer pointed to by `a` is greater than the value of the integer pointed to by `b`, the function returns 1.\n   - If the values of the two integers are equal, the function returns 0.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**:\n   - This function is typically used as a comparison function for the `qsort` function, which is used to sort an array of elements in place.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n   - `a` and `b`: Pointers to the integers being compared.\n   - Return value: -1 if the value of the integer pointed to by `a` is less than the value of the integer pointed to by `b`, 1 if the value of the integer pointed to by `a` is greater than the value of the integer pointed to by `b`, and 0 if the values of the two integers are equal.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**:\n   - This function does not perform any RDK-specific operations.",
