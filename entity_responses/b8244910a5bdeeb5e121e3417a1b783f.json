  "response": "**1. Main Purpose and Functionality**\n\nThe pjs_ovs_bool_to_json function converts a boolean value to a JSON value and adds it to an existing JSON object. It is used to facilitate the serialization of boolean data in the context of RDK.\n\n**2. Key Operations and Data Flow**\n\n- The function takes a boolean input value (in), a pointer to a JSON object (js), the name of the JSON property to be added (name), and an error message buffer (err).\n- It internally invokes the pjs_ovs_basic_to_json function, which is a generic function for converting various basic data types to JSON.\n- The pjs_bool_t_to_json function is used to convert the boolean value to its corresponding JSON representation.\n- The converted JSON value is added to the specified JSON object with the given name as the property name.\n\n**3. Interaction with Other Components (if any)**\n\n- None mentioned in the provided code snippet.\n\n**4. Important Parameters and Return Values**\n\n- **in**: The boolean value to be converted to JSON.\n- **js**: Pointer to the JSON object to which the property will be added.\n- **name**: Name of the JSON property to be added.\n- **err**: Error message buffer (optional).\n- **Return Value**: True on success, otherwise false.\n\n**5. Any Specific RDK-related Operations**\n\n- The function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component within RDK, which is responsible for managing Wi-Fi-related operations in RDK-based devices.\n- The process of serializing boolean values to JSON is relevant to RDK's data exchange and configuration mechanisms.",
