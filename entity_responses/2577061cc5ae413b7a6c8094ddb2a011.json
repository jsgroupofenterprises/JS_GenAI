  "response": "**1. Purpose of this structure**:\n\nThe purpose of the moca_aca_cfg_t structure is to provide configuration parameters for the ACA (Channel Assessment) testing in RDK (Reference Design Kit) for MoCA (Multimedia over Coax Alliance) devices. It allows developers to specify the parameters for starting the ACA testing on a specific node, channel, and set of participating nodes.\n\n**2. Key fields and their significance**:\n\n* **NodeID**: The NodeID where the ACA testing is to be started.\n* **Type**: The type of probe to be used for the ACA testing, either EVM (Error Vector Magnitude) or Quite.\n* **Channel**: The channel on which the ACA testing is to be performed.\n* **ReportNodes**: A bitmask specifying the MoCA nodes that are requested to participate in the ACA testing.\n* **ACAStart**: A flag indicating whether to start the ACA testing process or not.\n\n**3. Usage context in RDK**:\n\nThe moca_aca_cfg_t structure is used in the RDK HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) component to configure the ACA testing parameters. Developers can use this structure to specify the desired ACA testing configuration and initiate the testing process.\n\n**4. Related components or interfaces**:\n\nThe moca_aca_cfg_t structure is used in conjunction with the following components or interfaces:\n\n* MoCA HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)\n* MoCA ACA (Channel Assessment) Testing\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related details**:\n\nThe moca_aca_cfg_t structure is a part of the RDK HAL API (Application Programming Interface) and is specific to RDK-based MoCA devices. It allows developers to easily configure and start the ACA testing process in RDK environments.",
