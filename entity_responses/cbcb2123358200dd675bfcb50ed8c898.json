  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - The `os_nif_softwds_destroy` function is responsible for destroying (deleting) a soft wireless distribution system (softWDS) link with the given interface name (`ifname`). \n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n   - The function starts by constructing a command string `cmd` using `snprintf` to execute the `ip link del` command with the `ifname` interface name.\n   - It then invokes `cmd_log` to execute the command and capture its exit status.\n   - If the `cmd_log` call fails or the command exits with a non-zero status, an error message is logged using `LOG` with the command string, indicating that the softWDS link deletion failed. In this case, the function returns `false`.\n   - If the command execution is successful (exit code 0), the function returns `true`, indicating that the softWDS link was successfully destroyed.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components:**\n   - The function interacts with the underlying operating system to execute the `ip link del` command.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n   - **`ifname`**: The name of the softWDS link interface to be destroyed.\n   - **Return value**: `true` if the softWDS link was successfully destroyed, `false` otherwise.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n   - The function does not perform any RDK-specific operations and is primarily concerned with managing network interfaces.",
