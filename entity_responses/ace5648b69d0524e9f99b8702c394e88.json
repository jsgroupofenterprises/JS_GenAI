  "response": "**Main purpose and functionality:**\nThe `webconf_copy_wifi_security_params` function is responsible for extracting and copying Wi-Fi security parameters from a message pack object into a `webconf_security_t` structure.\n\n**Key operations and data flow:**\n1. It iterates through the key-value pairs in the message pack object.\n2. For each key-value pair, it checks the key to identify the corresponding security parameter.\n3. If the key matches a security parameter, it checks the value type to ensure it's a string.\n4. If the value type is a string, it copies the string value into the corresponding field in the `webconf_security_t` structure.\n\n**Interaction with other components (if any):**\nThis function interacts with the `webconf` component, which provides functions for managing Wi-Fi configurations.\n\n**Important parameters and return values:**\n* `obj`: Message pack object containing the Wi-Fi security parameters.\n* `security`: Pointer to the `webconf_security_t` structure where the security parameters will be copied.\n* Return value:\n    * `RETURN_OK` if the parameters were copied successfully.\n    * `RETURN_ERR` if there was an error copying the parameters or if the value type was not a string.\n\n**Specific RDK-related operations:**\nThis function is specific to RDK (Reference Design Kit) systems and is used to manage Wi-Fi security configurations in a standardized way across different devices and platforms.",
