  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `wifi_getInterworkingAccessNetworkType` function in the RDK HAL component is used to retrieve the Interworking Access Network Type (IANT) for a given Access Point (AP). The IANT indicates the type of network to which the AP is connected, such as a cellular network or a public Wi-Fi hotspot.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n* `apIndex`: The index of the AP for which the IANT is to be retrieved.\n* `output_uint`: A pointer to a UINT variable in which the IANT will be returned.\n\nThe function first checks if the AP index is valid. If the index is invalid, the function returns -1.\n\nIf the AP index is valid, the function retrieves the IANT from the AP. The IANT is stored in the `accessNetworkType` field of the `wifi_InterworkingElement_t` structure.\n\nThe function then copies the IANT from the `wifi_InterworkingElement_t` structure to the output_uint variable.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `wifi_getInterworkingAccessNetworkType` function interacts with the following components:\n\n* The Wi-Fi driver: The function uses the Wi-Fi driver to retrieve the IANT from the AP.\n* The HAL: The function uses the HAL to access the Wi-Fi driver.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following parameters are important:\n\n* `apIndex`: The index of the AP for which the IANT is to be retrieved.\n* `output_uint`: A pointer to a UINT variable in which the IANT will be returned.\n\nThe function returns the following values:\n\n* 0: Success\n* -1: Invalid AP index\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `wifi_getInterworkingAccessNetworkType` function is not specific to RDK. It is a generic function that can be used with any Wi-Fi driver that supports the Interworking Access Network Type feature.",
