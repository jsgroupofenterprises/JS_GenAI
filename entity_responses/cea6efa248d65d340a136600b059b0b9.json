Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\n   - The function does not directly interact with any other components.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**\n\n   - `ifname`: The name of the network interface from which the gateway will be deleted.\n   - `gwaddr`: The IP address of the gateway to be deleted.\n   - Return value: `true` if the gateway was deleted successfully, `false` otherwise.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\n   - The function does not perform any RDK-specific operations.",
