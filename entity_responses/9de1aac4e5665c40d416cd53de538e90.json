  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `convert_radio_to_name` function in `CcspWifiAgent` converts a radio index into its corresponding name. This is useful for identifying and managing different radios on an RDK device.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n- The function takes two parameters:\n    - `index`: The index of the radio (1 or 2)\n    - `name`: A pointer to a character buffer that will receive the radio name\n- The function checks the `index` value and assigns the corresponding name to the `name` buffer:\n    - If `index` is 1, the name is set to \"radio1\"\n    - If `index` is 2, the name is set to \"radio2\"\n- The function returns 0 if successful or -1 if an invalid `index` is provided.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThis function does not directly interact with other components. However, it is used by other RDK components that need to manage and identify different radio interfaces.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n- `index`: The index of the radio to convert to a name.\n- `name`: A pointer to a character buffer that will receive the radio name.\n- Return value: 0 if successful or -1 if an invalid index is provided.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThis function is specifically designed for use in RDK devices. It uses the `BUFFER_LENGTH_OVSDB` constant to ensure that the `name` buffer is large enough to hold the radio name.",
