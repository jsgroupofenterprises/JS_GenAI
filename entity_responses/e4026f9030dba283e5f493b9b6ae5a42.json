  "response": "**Main purpose and functionality:**\nThe wifi_getApAssociatedDevice function retrieves the MAC addresses of the devices associated with the specified access point.\n\n**Key operations and data flow:**\n\n1. The function takes as input the access point index (ap_index), a pointer to an array of mac_address_t structures (output_deviceMacAddressArray), the maximum number of devices to retrieve (maxNumDevices), and a pointer to a UINT variable to store the number of devices actually retrieved (output_numDevices).\n2. The function internally calls the driver to retrieve the MAC addresses of the associated devices.\n3. The MAC addresses are stored in the output_deviceMacAddressArray array, and the number of devices retrieved is stored in the output_numDevices variable.\n\n**Interaction with other components:**\n\nThe function interacts with the Wi-Fi driver to retrieve the MAC addresses of the associated devices.\n\n**Important parameters and return values:**\n\n* **ap_index:** The index of the access point to retrieve the associated devices from.\n* **output_deviceMacAddressArray:** A pointer to an array of mac_address_t structures to store the MAC addresses of the associated devices.\n* **maxNumDevices:** The maximum number of devices to retrieve.\n* **output_numDevices:** A pointer to a UINT variable to store the number of devices actually retrieved.\n* **Return value:** The function returns RETURN_OK if successful, or RETURN_ERR if an error occurred.\n\n**RDK-related operations:**\n\nThis function is part of the RDK Wi-Fi HAL API, which provides a standard interface for Wi-Fi operations across different RDK platforms.",
