  "response": "## docsis_GetNumOfActiveTxChannels\n\n### Main purpose and functionality\n\nThe `docsis_GetNumOfActiveTxChannels` function in the RDK hal component is used to retrieve the number of active transmit (Tx) channels in the current registration. This function is typically used by the cable modem (CM) to manage its downstream (DS) channels.\n\n### Key operations and data flow\n\nThe key operations and data flow of the `docsis_GetNumOfActiveTxChannels` function are as follows:\n\n1. The function takes a pointer to an unsigned long variable as its input parameter. This variable will store the number of active Tx channels.\n2. The function retrieves the number of active Tx channels from the CM's hardware.\n3. The function stores the number of active Tx channels in the input variable.\n4. The function returns a status code indicating whether the operation was successful.\n\n### Interaction with other components (if any)\n\nThe `docsis_GetNumOfActiveTxChannels` function may interact with the following other components:\n\n* The CM's hardware driver\n* The CM's management software\n\n### Important parameters and return values\n\nThe following are the important parameters and return values of the `docsis_GetNumOfActiveTxChannels` function:\n\n* **Parameters:**\n    * `cnt`: A pointer to an unsigned long variable that will store the number of active Tx channels.\n* **Return values:**\n    * `RETURN_OK`: The operation was successful.\n    * `RETURN_ERR`: The operation failed.\n\n### Any specific RDK-related operations\n\nThe `docsis_GetNumOfActiveTxChannels` function is not specific to RDK. It is a generic function that can be used by any CM that supports the DOCSIS standard.",
