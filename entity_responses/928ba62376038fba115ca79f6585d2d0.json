  "response": "**Main purpose and functionality:**\nThe purpose of the wifi_getApAclDevices function is to retrieve the list of MAC addresses that are granted access to the specified Access Point (AP).\n\n**Key operations and data flow:**\nThe function takes the following parameters:\n- apIndex: The index of the AP for which the ACL devices are to be retrieved.\n- macArray: A pre-allocated array of mac_address_t structures to receive the MAC addresses of the ACL devices.\n- maxArraySize: The maximum number of MAC addresses that can be stored in the macArray.\n- output_numEntries: A pointer to a UINT variable to receive the number of MAC addresses in the ACL.\n\nThe function retrieves the ACL devices from the specified AP and stores them in the macArray. The number of MAC addresses in the ACL is returned in the output_numEntries parameter.\n\n**Interaction with other components (if any):**\nThis function interacts with the Wi-Fi driver to retrieve the ACL devices from the specified AP.\n\n**Important parameters and return values:**\n- apIndex: The index of the AP for which the ACL devices are to be retrieved.\n- macArray: A pre-allocated array of mac_address_t structures to receive the MAC addresses of the ACL devices.\n- maxArraySize: The maximum number of MAC addresses that can be stored in the macArray.\n- output_numEntries: A pointer to a UINT variable to receive the number of MAC addresses in the ACL.\n\n**Any specific RDK-related operations:**\nThis function is used by the RDK Wi-Fi Manager to manage the ACL devices for each AP.",
