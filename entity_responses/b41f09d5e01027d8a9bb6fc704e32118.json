  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - The `pjs_int_array_to_json` function in CcspWifiAgent converts an array of integers (`in_data`) of length `in_num` to a JSON array and adds it to the specified JSON object (`js`) with the given `name`. This function simplifies the process of serializing integer arrays into JSON format for further processing or transmission.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n   - It first calls the `pjs_generic_array_to_json` function, passing in the appropriate conversion function (`pjs_int_t_to_json`) and other parameters.\n   - `pjs_generic_array_to_json` handles the core conversion logic by iterating through the integer array and converting each element to a JSON value using the provided conversion function.\n   - The resulting JSON array is then added to the parent JSON object (`js`) with the specified `name`.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components:**\n   - The `pjs_int_array_to_json` function is intended for use within the CcspWifiAgent component, which primarily handles Wi-Fi related functionality in RDK-based devices. It is not typically called directly from outside the CcspWifiAgent.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n   - `in_data`: Pointer to the array of integers to be converted.\n   - `in_num`: Length of the integer array.\n   - `js`: Pointer to the JSON object where the resulting JSON array will be added.\n   - `name`: Name of the JSON array to be added to the `js` object.\n   - `err`: Pointer to an error message structure for reporting any errors that occur during the conversion process.\n   - Return value: `true` if the conversion was successful, `false` otherwise.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n   - The `pjs_int_array_to_json` function is part of the RDK Platform Services (RDK-PS) libraries, which provide a set of common utilities and abstractions for RDK-based devices.",
