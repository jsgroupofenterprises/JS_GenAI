  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `wifi_setFTOverDSActivated` function sets the Fast Transition (FT) Over-the-DS (DS) status for the specified Access Point (AP) index in the RDK WLAN HAL. FT is a mechanism that allows a client to perform a fast roaming between APs within the same Extended Service Set Identifier (ESSID) without the need to re-authenticate with the Authentication Server. The DS status indicates whether FT over DS is enabled or disabled for the specified AP.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n* `apIndex`: The index of the AP for which the FT over DS status is to be set.\n* `activate`: A pointer to a boolean value that specifies the desired FT over DS status. A value of `TRUE` enables FT over DS, while a value of `FALSE` disables it.\n\nThe function sets the FT over DS status in the HAL data structures for the specified AP.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `wifi_setFTOverDSActivated` function interacts with the following other components:\n\n* The WLAN HAL driver, which is responsible for implementing the FT over DS functionality.\n* The WLAN Host driver, which provides the interface between the user space application and the WLAN HAL driver.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following parameters and return values are important to note:\n\n* `apIndex`: The index of the AP for which the FT over DS status is to be set. The valid range for `apIndex` is 0 to the maximum number of APs supported by the RDK WLAN HAL.\n* `activate`: A pointer to a boolean value that specifies the desired FT over DS status. A value of `TRUE` enables FT over DS, while a value of `FALSE` disables it.\n* The function returns `RETURN_OK` if the operation is successful. Otherwise, it returns `RETURN_ERR`.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `wifi_setFTOverDSActivated` function is a specific RDK-related operation. It is used to set the FT over DS status for an AP in the RDK WLAN HAL.",
