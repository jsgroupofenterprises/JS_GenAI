  "response": "**1. Main Purpose and Functionality**\n\nThe `mon_sig_str` function is part of the OneWifi monitor component in RDK. Its purpose is to convert a signal number (`signum`) into a string representation (`strsig`) with a maximum size of `strsig_sz`. This is useful for logging or displaying signal-related information.\n\n**2. Key Operations and Data Flow**\n\nThe function takes three parameters:\n- `signum`: The signal number to convert.\n- `strsig`: A pointer to the buffer where the string representation of the signal will be stored.\n- `strsig_sz`: The maximum size of the buffer pointed to by `strsig`.\n\nThe function uses a switch statement to map the `signum` to a corresponding string representation. For example, `SIGTERM` is mapped to \"SIGTERM\" and `SIGINT` is mapped to \"SIGINT\". If the `signum` is not recognized, the function sets `strsig` to \"Unknown signal\".\n\n**3. Interaction with Other Components**\n\nThe `mon_sig_str` function is typically used in conjunction with other OneWifi monitor components, such as `mon_start()` and `mon_install_signals()`. These components work together to provide process monitoring and signal handling functionality.\n\n**4. Important Parameters and Return Values**\n\n- `signum`: The signal number to convert.\n- `strsig`: A pointer to the buffer where the string representation of the signal will be stored.\n- `strsig_sz`: The maximum size of the buffer pointed to by `strsig`.\n\nThe function does not return any value.\n\n**5. Any Specific RDK-related Operations**\n\nThe `mon_sig_str` function is specific to the OneWifi monitor component in RDK. It is not part of the standard C library.",
