  "response": "1. Main purpose and functionality:\n   - The callback_Wifi_Security_Config function is a callback function that is invoked when there is a change in the Wifi_Security_Config table in the OVSDB database.\n   - It is used to handle the creation, deletion, and modification of Wifi_Security_Config records in the database.\n\n2. Key operations and data flow:\n   - The function takes three parameters:\n     - mon: A pointer to the ovsdb_update_monitor_t structure that contains information about the update.\n     - old_rec: A pointer to the old Wifi_Security_Config record, if any.\n     - new_rec: A pointer to the new Wifi_Security_Config record, if any.\n   - The function first checks the mon_type field of the mon structure to determine the type of update that has occurred.\n   - If the mon_type is OVSDB_UPDATE_DEL, the function prints a message to indicate that a record has been deleted.\n   - If the mon_type is OVSDB_UPDATE_NEW, the function prints a message to indicate that a new record has been created.\n   - If the mon_type is OVSDB_UPDATE_MODIFY, the function prints a message to indicate that a record has been modified.\n   - If the mon_type is not one of these values, the function prints a message to indicate that an unknown update has occurred.\n\n3. Interaction with other components (if any):\n   - The callback_Wifi_Security_Config function interacts with the CcspWifiAgent component, which is responsible for managing WiFi settings on a RDK device.\n   - When the Wifi_Security_Config table is modified, the CcspWifiAgent component calls the callback_Wifi_Security_Config function to notify it of the change.\n\n4. Important parameters and return values:\n   - mon: A pointer to the ovsdb_update_monitor_t structure that contains information about the update.\n   - old_rec: A pointer to the old Wifi_Security_Config record, if any.\n   - new_rec: A pointer to the new Wifi_Security_Config record, if any.\n   - The function does not return any value.\n\n5. Any specific RDK-related operations:\n   - The callback_Wifi_Security_Config function is used to handle the creation, deletion, and modification of Wifi_Security_Config records in the OVSDB database, which is a key component of the RDK software stack.",
