  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\nThe purpose of the `process_passpoint_event` function is to handle passpoint events, which are used to perform Wi-Fi authentication and authorization. This function processes ANQP (Access Network Query Protocol) requests, which are used by client devices to query the network for information. \n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n* The function takes an `cosa_wifi_anqp_context_t` structure as input, which contains information about the ANQP request.\n* It starts by checking if the RFC (Radio Frequency Coordination) feature is enabled and if the passpoint is enabled on the access point (AP). \n* If both conditions are met, it proceeds to process the ANQP request. \n* It then validates the AP index and the request data. \n* It increments the statistics for gas queries. \n* It checks if the RFC feature is enabled and if the passpoint is enabled on the AP. \n* If both conditions are met, it proceeds to process the ANQP request. \n* It then validates the AP index and the request data. \n* It increments the statistics for gas queries. \n* Next, it iterates through the list of ANQP elements in the request. \n* For each element, it checks the element type and the element id. \n* Depending on the type and id, it copies the appropriate data from the interworking data structure into the response structure. \n* It then updates the response length and the interworking data structure. \n* Finally, it sends the ANQP response to the client device.\n\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\nThis function may interact with the following components:\n* The Wi-Fi driver\n* The network management system\n* The authentication server\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\nThe important parameters of this function are:\n* `anqpReq`: A pointer to the `cosa_wifi_anqp_context_t` structure containing the ANQP request.\n\nThe function does not have a return value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\nThis function is specific to RDK as it uses the `cosa_wifi_anqp_context_t` structure, which is defined in the RDK Wi-Fi API.",
