  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `ovsdb_cache_find_by_key()` function in CcspWifiAgent searches for and returns a record in an OVSDB cache using a specified key.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n* The function takes two parameters:\n    * `table`: The OVSDB table to search in.\n    * `key`: The key to search for.\n* It calls the `ovsdb_cache_find_row_by_key()` function to find the row in the cache that corresponds to the given key.\n* If a row is found, the function returns the `record` member of the `ovsdb_cache_row_t` struct, which is the data associated with the row.\n* Otherwise, it returns NULL.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThe function interacts with the OVSDB cache, which is a component responsible for storing and managing data from OVSDB.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n* `table`: The OVSDB table to search in.\n* `key`: The key to search for.\n* Return value: A pointer to the record associated with the row found with the given key, or NULL if no row is found.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThis function is part of the CcspWifiAgent, which is a component of the RDK software suite. It is used to manage OVSDB data for Wi-Fi devices in RDK environments.",
