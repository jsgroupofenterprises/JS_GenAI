  "response": "## Analysis of start_simulator Function\n\n### 1. Main Purpose and Functionality\n\nThe `start_simulator()` function is responsible for initializing and starting the simulator component in the CcspWifiAgent component of RDK. It simulates wifi connections and disconnections for testing and debugging purposes.\n\n### 2. Key Operations and Data Flow\n\n* Initializes mutex and condition variables for synchronization.\n* Creates and configures multiple simulated devices with unique MAC addresses, RSSI values, and connection status.\n* Starts two threads:\n    * `simulate_connect_disconnect`: Simulates random connection and disconnection events.\n    * `wifi_connections_listener`: Monitors WifiAgent events and updates simulator state accordingly.\n\n### 3. Interaction with Other Components (if any)\n\nThe simulator does not directly interact with other RDK components.\n\n### 4. Important Parameters and Return Values\n\n* The function takes no parameters.\n* It returns 0 on success and -1 on failure to create the simulator threads.\n\n### 5. Any specific RDK-related operations\n\nThe function initializes the simulator using RDK-specific data structures and debugging macros for error reporting.",
