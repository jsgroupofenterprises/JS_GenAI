  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `rdk_wifi_GetApMacFilterMode` function retrieves the MAC filter mode of a specified Wi-Fi access point (AP) interface. The MAC filter mode determines whether the AP allows or denies access to devices based on their MAC addresses.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n- The function takes two parameters: `wlanIndex`, which specifies the index of the AP interface to query, and `mode`, a pointer to an integer that will receive the MAC filter mode.\n- The function first calls the `rdk_wifi_vap_get_from_index` function to retrieve the Wi-Fi virtual access point (VAP) information associated with the specified AP interface.\n- If the VAP information is successfully retrieved, the function extracts the `mac_filter_mode` field from the VAP's BSS (Basic Service Set) information structure and stores it in the `mode` parameter.\n- The function then returns the result of the operation, which is `CCSP_SUCCESS` if the operation was successful or an error code otherwise.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `rdk_wifi_GetApMacFilterMode` function interacts with the following components:\n\n- The Wi-Fi driver, which provides the underlying functionality for managing Wi-Fi APs and interfaces.\n- The Wi-Fi database (wifidb), which stores the configuration and state information for Wi-Fi APs and interfaces.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n- `wlanIndex`: The index of the AP interface to query.\n- `mode`: A pointer to an integer that will receive the MAC filter mode.\n- The function returns `CCSP_SUCCESS` if the operation was successful or an error code otherwise.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `rdk_wifi_GetApMacFilterMode` function is a part of the RDK Wi-Fi Agent component, which provides a set of APIs for managing Wi-Fi APs and interfaces on RDK devices.",
