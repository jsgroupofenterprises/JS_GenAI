  "response": "1. Main purpose and functionality:\n   - ssp_WifiMbi_EventCallback is a callback function for DBus events related to the CcspWifiAgent component. It's responsible for handling incoming DBus messages and taking appropriate actions based on the message's interface and method.\n\n2. Key operations and data flow:\n   - The function retrieves the interface and method of the incoming DBus message.\n   - It then prints the interface and method names for debugging purposes.\n   - Although the code doesn't show any specific actions taken based on the message content, it's likely that the actual implementation would involve further processing and handling of the event.\n\n3. Interaction with other components (if any):\n   - The function doesn't directly interact with other components but is part of the CcspWifiAgent component, which may interact with other RDK components.\n\n4. Important parameters and return values:\n   - conn: The DBus connection object.\n   - message: The DBus message object carrying the event information.\n   - user_data: A user-provided data pointer that can be used to pass additional context to the callback.\n   - Return value: The function returns DBUS_HANDLER_RESULT_HANDLED, indicating that it has handled the message successfully.\n\n5. Any specific RDK-related operations:\n   - The function itself doesn't contain any RDK-specific operations, but its existence and usage within the CcspWifiAgent component are part of the RDK architecture, where DBus is used for inter-component communication.",
