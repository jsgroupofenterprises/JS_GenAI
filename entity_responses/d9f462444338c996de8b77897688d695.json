  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**:\n   \n   This function, qm_conn_server, establishes a server socket for communication using the Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) mechanism. It creates a listening socket and binds it to a specified path, allowing other processes to connect to this server.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n\n   - Creates a UDS socket using the `socket()` function.\n   - Binds the socket to a specific path using the `bind()` function. This path is where other processes can connect to the server.\n   - Sets up the socket to listen for incoming connections using the `listen()` function.\n   - Returns the file descriptor of the listening socket to the caller through the `pfd` parameter.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components**:\n\n   This function does not directly interact with other components but provides a communication endpoint for other processes to connect to and exchange messages.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n\n   - `pfd`: A pointer to an integer variable where the file descriptor of the listening socket will be stored.\n   - The function returns a boolean value:\n     - `true` if the server socket is successfully created and bound.\n     - `false` if any error occurs during socket creation or binding.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**:\n\n   This function does not perform any RDK-specific operations. It uses standard Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) for inter-process communication.",
