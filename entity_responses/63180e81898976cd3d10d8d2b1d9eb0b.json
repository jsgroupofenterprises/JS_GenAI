  "response": "**1. Main Purpose and Functionality**\n\nThe `csnprintf` function in CcspWifiAgent is a custom implementation of `snprintf` that provides formatted string printing with dynamic buffer reallocation.\n\n**2. Key Operations and Data Flow**\n\n* The function takes a pointer to a character buffer (`str`), its size (`size`), a format string (`fmt`), and a variable list of arguments (`...`) to print into the buffer.\n* It uses `vsnprintf` to print the formatted string into the existing buffer.\n* If the printed length exceeds the available buffer size, it reallocates the buffer to accommodate the new size, updates pointers, and continues printing.\n\n**3. Interaction with Other Components**\n\nThe function does not directly interact with other components but can be used by various modules that need to print formatted strings.\n\n**4. Important Parameters and Return Values**\n\n* **char **str**: Pointer to the character buffer to write to.\n* **size_t *size**: Pointer to the size of the character buffer.\n* **const char *fmt**: Format string specifying how to print the arguments.\n* **...**: Variable list of arguments to print into the buffer.\n\nThe function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null-terminator) or a negative value if an error occurs.\n\n**5. Specific RDK-related Operations**\n\nThe function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component in the RDK, providing formatted string printing for RDK applications and modules.",
