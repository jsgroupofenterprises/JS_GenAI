  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `ovsdb_where_multi` function in CcspWifiAgent combines multiple JSON arrays representing OVSDB where clauses into a single array. This allows for more complex OVSDB queries to be constructed.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n- The function takes a variable number of JSON arrays representing where clauses as input.\n- It iterates through the input arrays and appends each element to the first input array, which is modified in place.\n- The function returns the modified first input array, which now contains all the where clauses from the input arrays.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThe function is typically used in conjunction with other CcspWifiAgent functions to construct OVSDB queries.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n- **where**: A JSON array representing the base where clause.\n- **...**: A variable number of JSON arrays representing additional where clauses.\n- **Return value**: A JSON array representing the combined where clause.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThe function uses the `json_t` data structure, which is provided by the RDK JSON library.",
