Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThis function, ActiveMeasurement_Step_Rollback, is part of the CcspWifiAgent component and handles the rollback of changes made to the Active Measurement Step configuration. It reverts the configuration to its previous state.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n- The function takes an ANSC_HANDLE hInsContext as input, which is a pointer to the Active Measurement Step configuration (PCOSA_DML_WIFI_ACTIVE_MSMT_STEP_CFG).\n- It checks if the source MAC address (bSrcMacChanged) or the destination MAC address (bDstMacChanged) has been modified.\n- If either of the MAC addresses has been changed, the function reverts the change by setting the corresponding boolean flag to false.\n- The function returns ANSC_STATUS_SUCCESS if the rollback is successful.\n\n**3.
