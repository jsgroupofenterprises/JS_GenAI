  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe ActiveMeasurement_Step_Commit function in the CcspWifiAgent component is responsible for committing changes made to the source and destination MAC addresses of an active measurement step.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n1. Retrieves the instance number of the active measurement step.\n2. If the source MAC address has changed, it updates the source MAC address in the data model.\n3. If the destination MAC address has changed, it updates the destination MAC address in the data model.\n4. Returns a success status if both updates were successful.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThis function interacts with the data model to update the source and destination MAC addresses of the active measurement step.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n* `hInsContext`: A handle to the active measurement step instance.\n* Return value: A ULONG indicating the status of the operation.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThis function is part of the RDK implementation for active measurement, which is used for monitoring and optimizing Wi-Fi performance.",
