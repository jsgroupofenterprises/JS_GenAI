  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\nThis function adds a MAC filter configuration to the Wi-Fi database. It is used to restrict access to the Wi-Fi network based on MAC addresses.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\nThe function takes two parameters:\n* `ap_index`: The index of the access point to which the MAC filter is being added.\n* `pMacFilt`: A pointer to a `PCOSA_DML_WIFI_AP_MAC_FILTER` structure containing the MAC filter configuration.\n\nThe function first checks if the MAC filter instance is NULL and returns an error if it is.\nIt then retrieves the VAP name for the specified access point index.\nNext, it checks if the MAC address in the MAC filter configuration is valid and returns an error if it is not.\nThe function then constructs a MAC filter key using the VAP name and MAC address.\nIt then populates a `schema_Wifi_MacFilter_Config` structure with the MAC filter configuration and attempts to upsert the structure into the OVSDB table `table_Wifi_MacFilter_Config`.\nIf the upsert is successful, the function returns 0; otherwise, it returns -1.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\nThis function interacts with the following components:\n* OVSDB: The function uses the OVSDB library to upsert the MAC filter configuration into the database.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\nThe following parameters are important:\n* `ap_index`: The index of the access point to which the MAC filter is being added.\n* `pMacFilt`: A pointer to a `PCOSA_DML_WIFI_AP_MAC_FILTER` structure containing the MAC filter configuration.\n\nThe following return values are important:\n* 0: The MAC filter configuration was successfully added to the database.\n* -1: An error occurred while adding the MAC filter configuration to the database.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\nThis function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
