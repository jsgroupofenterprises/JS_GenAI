  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `voice_hal_setBoundIfName` function is used to specify the name of the interface that will be used for outbound traffic by the voice service. This is necessary because the voice service may be running on a device with multiple network interfaces, and it is important to specify which interface will be used for outbound traffic.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe `voice_hal_setBoundIfName` function takes two arguments:\n\n* `service`: The service ID of the voice service that will be using the specified interface.\n* `boundIpAddress`: The name of the interface that will be used for outbound traffic.\n\nThe function first checks to make sure that the specified service ID is valid. If the service ID is invalid, the function will return an error.\n\nIf the service ID is valid, the function will then check to make sure that the specified interface name is valid. If the interface name is invalid, the function will return an error.\n\nIf both the service ID and the interface name are valid, the function will then set the specified interface as the outbound interface for the specified service.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `voice_hal_setBoundIfName` function interacts with the following components:\n\n* The voice service that will be using the specified interface.\n* The network interface that will be used for outbound traffic.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following table describes the important parameters and return values of the `voice_hal_setBoundIfName` function:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n|---|---|\n| `service` | The service ID of the voice service that will be using the specified interface. |\n| `boundIpAddress` | The name of the interface that will be used for outbound traffic. |\n| Return value | The status of the operation. |\n\nThe following table describes the possible return values of the `voice_hal_setBoundIfName` function:\n\n| Return value | Description |\n|---|---|\n| `RDK_SUCCESS` | The operation was successful. |\n| `RDK_FAILURE` | The operation failed. |\n| `RDK_ERROR_OOM` | The operation failed due to a lack of memory. |\n\n**5.
