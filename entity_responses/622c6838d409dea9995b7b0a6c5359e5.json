  "response": "## Function Overview\nThe `wifi_setBandSteeringApGroup` function sets the band steering AP group. Band steering is a feature that automatically steers clients to the best available band (2.4 GHz or 5 GHz) based on signal strength, interference, and other factors.\n\n## Key Operations and Data Flow\nThe `wifi_setBandSteeringApGroup` function takes a single parameter:\n* `ApGroup`: The name of the band steering AP group to set.\n\nThe function sets the specified AP group as the current band steering group. This means that all clients that are associated with the AP group will be subject to band steering.\n\n## Interaction with Other Components\nThe `wifi_setBandSteeringApGroup` function may interact with the following components:\n* The Wi-Fi driver\n* The band steering algorithm\n* The network management system\n\n## Important Parameters and Return Values\n* `ApGroup`: The name of the band steering AP group to set.\n* `INT`: The status of the operation.\n\nThe function returns one of the following values:\n* `RETURN_OK`: The function completed successfully.\n* `RETURN_ERR`: The function failed.\n\n## RDK-Related Operations\nThe `wifi_setBandSteeringApGroup` function is not specific to RDK. It is a general Wi-Fi function that can be used in any RDK-based device.\n\n## Additional Notes\n* The band steering AP group is a logical group of APs that share the same band steering settings.\n* The band steering algorithm is responsible for deciding which band to steer clients to.\n* The network management system can be used to configure the band steering settings.",
