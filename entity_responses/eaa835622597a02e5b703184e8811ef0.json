  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - The `pjs_ovs_smap_string_to_json` function converts a string map (where keys and values are both strings) to a JSON representation.\n   -  It takes in a list of keys, a list of values, and the number of key-value pairs, and creates a JSON object with the keys as property names and the values as property values.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow:**\n   - The function first initializes two `pjs_string_args` structs, which store the pointers to the keys and values and their sizes.\n   - It then calls the `pjs_ovs_map_to_json` function to convert the map to JSON.\n   - The `pjs_ovs_map_to_json` function iterates over the keys and values, calling `pjs_string_t_to_json` to convert each key and value to a JSON string.\n   - The JSON strings are then added to a JSON object, which is returned by the function.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any):**\n   - The function interacts with the `pjs_ovs_map_to_json` function to convert the map to JSON.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values:**\n   - `keys`: A pointer to the array of keys.\n   - `key_sz`: The size of the `keys` array.\n   - `in_data`: A pointer to the array of values.\n   - `in_sz`: The size of the `in_data` array.\n   - `in_num`: The number of key-value pairs in the map.\n   - `js`: A pointer to the JSON object to store the result.\n   - `name`: The name of the JSON object.\n   - `err`: A pointer to an error message buffer.\n   - `Returns`: True if the conversion was successful, False otherwise.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n   - The function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
