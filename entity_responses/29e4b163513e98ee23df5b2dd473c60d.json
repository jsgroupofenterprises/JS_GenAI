  "response": "1.\t**Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe DPP (Device Provisioning Protocol) API provides a way for devices to securely connect to a Wi-Fi network without the need for a password. DPP uses a public key infrastructure (PKI) to authenticate devices, and it can be used with both open and WPA2-PSK networks.\n\n2.\t**Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe DPP process begins when a device initiates a connection to a Wi-Fi network. The device sends a DPP Request message to the network, which contains the device's public key and a nonce. The network responds with a DPP Response message, which contains the network's public key and a nonce. The device and the network then use their public keys to generate a shared secret key. This shared secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt all subsequent communications between the device and the network.\n\n3.\t**Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe DPP API interacts with the following other components:\n\n- The Wi-Fi driver\n- The network security stack\n- The device provisioning service\n\n4.\t**Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following are the most important parameters and return values used by the DPP API:\n\n- DPP Request message: This message is sent by the device to the network to initiate a DPP connection. It contains the device's public key and a nonce.\n- DPP Response message: This message is sent by the network to the device in response to a DPP Request message. It contains the network's public key and a nonce.\n- Shared secret key: This key is generated by the device and the network using their public keys. It is used to encrypt and decrypt all subsequent communications between the device and the network.\n- Return values: The DPP API returns a variety of return values, including:\n\n    - RETURN_OK: The operation was successful.\n    - RETURN_ERR: The operation failed.\n    - RETURN_NOTIMPL: The operation is not implemented.\n\n5.\t**Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe DPP API does not have any specific RDK-related operations.",
