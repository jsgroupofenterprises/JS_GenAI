  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `clock_sleep` function provides a precise sleep for a specified duration (in seconds). It does this using the `clock_nanosleep` system call, which suspends the calling thread for a specified amount of real time. The `clock_sleep` function is used by other components in the CcspWifiAgent to implement timed operations, such as waiting for a response from a remote device.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n- The function takes a single parameter, `tts`, which is the duration of the sleep in seconds.\n- The function converts the `tts` parameter to a `timespec` structure, which represents a time interval in seconds and nanoseconds.\n- The function calls the `clock_nanosleep` system call, which suspends the calling thread for the specified time interval.\n- If the `clock_nanosleep` system call returns an error, the function returns the error code.\n- Otherwise, the function returns the remaining time that was not used during the sleep.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThe `clock_sleep` function is used by other components in the CcspWifiAgent to implement timed operations. For example, the `CcspWifiDevice` component uses the `clock_sleep` function to wait for a response from a remote device.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n- `tts`: The duration of the sleep in seconds.\n- The function returns the remaining time that was not used during the sleep.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThe `clock_sleep` function does not perform any RDK-specific operations.",
