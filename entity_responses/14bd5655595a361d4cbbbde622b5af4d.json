  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `wifi_setDownStreamGroupAddress` function is designed to enable or disable the Downstream Group Address (DGAF) feature for a specified Access Point (AP) index.\nDGAF is a mechanism used in wireless networks to optimize multicast traffic by allowing a single multicast frame to be sent to multiple devices simultaneously, instead of sending individual frames to each device.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes two parameters: an AP index and a flag to indicate whether DGAF should be enabled or disabled. Internally, the function interacts with the underlying hardware or driver to set the appropriate configuration.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThis function is typically used in conjunction with other Wi-Fi-related functions and APIs to manage and configure Wi-Fi settings on the device.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* **apIndex**: The index of the AP for which DGAF should be configured.\n* **disabled**: A flag indicating whether DGAF should be enabled (FALSE) or disabled (TRUE).\n* **Return value**: The function returns an integer status code indicating the result of the operation. A positive value indicates success, while a negative value indicates an error.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThis function is specifically designed for use in the RDK (Reference Design Kit) framework, which is used by various broadband and cable providers to develop and deploy their own software solutions.",
