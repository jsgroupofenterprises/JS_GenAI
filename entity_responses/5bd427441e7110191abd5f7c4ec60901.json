  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `events_APtable_addrowhandler` function is part of the RDK WifiAgent and is responsible for creating and registering a set of four RBUS events for each new row added to the `Device.WiFi.AccessPoint` table. These events are used to monitor connectivity and diagnostic information for the associated access point.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n* The function takes the following parameters:\n    * `handle`: RBUS handle for communication.\n    * `tableName`: Name of the table being modified.\n    * `aliasName`: Alias name of the instance being modified.\n    * `instNum`: Pointer to an integer that will store the instance number of the new row.\n* The function begins by incrementing the `instanceCounter` and assigning the value to the `instNum` parameter.\n* Then, it locks the `g_events_lock` mutex and proceeds to create and push four event elements into the `g_rbus_events_queue` queue.\n    * Each event element is allocated memory and configured with a unique name based on the `instNum` parameter and the event type.\n    * The event types are:\n        * `monitor_event_type_connect`: X_RDK_deviceConnected\n        * `monitor_event_type_disconnect`: X_RDK_deviceDisconnected\n        * `monitor_event_type_deauthenticate`: X_RDK_deviceDeauthenticated\n        * `monitor_event_type_diagnostics`: X_RDK_DiagData\n* Finally, the function unlocks the `g_events_lock` mutex and returns `RBUS_ERROR_SUCCESS`.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThis function interacts with the RBUS framework for event management.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n* `instNum`: Pointer to an integer that will store the instance number of the new row. This is an important output parameter that can be used to identify the events associated with the new access point instance.\n* The function returns `RBUS_ERROR_SUCCESS` on successful execution.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThis function is specifically designed to handle events related to the `Device.WiFi.AccessPoint` table, which is an RDK-specific table. The event names follow the RDK naming conventions for X_RDK_ events.",
