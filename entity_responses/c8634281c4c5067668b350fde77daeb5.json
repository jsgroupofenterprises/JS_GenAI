  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `platform_hal_GetFirmwareName` function is used to retrieve the name of the firmware that is currently running on the device. The firmware name is a string that identifies the specific version of the firmware that is installed.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe `platform_hal_GetFirmwareName` function takes two parameters:\n\n* `pValue`: A pointer to a buffer where the firmware name will be stored.\n* `maxSize`: The size of the buffer that was allocated to store the firmware name.\n\nThe function first checks to make sure that the buffer is large enough to store the firmware name. If the buffer is not large enough, the function returns an error. If the buffer is large enough, the function copies the firmware name into the buffer.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `platform_hal_GetFirmwareName` function does not interact with any other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following parameters and return values are important to note:\n\n* `pValue`: The pointer to the buffer where the firmware name will be stored.\n* `maxSize`: The size of the buffer that was allocated to store the firmware name.\n* `RETURN_OK`: The function returns `RETURN_OK` if the firmware name was successfully retrieved.\n* `RETURN_ERR`: The function returns `RETURN_ERR` if the firmware name could not be retrieved.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThis function is not specific to RDK.",
