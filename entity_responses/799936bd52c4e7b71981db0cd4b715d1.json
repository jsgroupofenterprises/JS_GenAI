  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**:\n   - The `wifi_radio_cfg_rollback_handler` function is responsible for rolling back any changes made to the Wi-Fi radio configuration.\n   - It is typically called when an error occurs during the Wi-Fi configuration process, or when the user cancels the configuration process.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n   - The function first retrieves the initial Wi-Fi radio configuration from the Data Model Layer (DML).\n   - It then applies the initial configuration to the Wi-Fi radio.\n   - Finally, the function applies any radio settings that were previously saved in the `radio_curr_cfg` variable.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**:\n   - The function interacts with the Wi-Fi HAL to apply the radio configuration.\n   - It also interacts with the DML to retrieve the initial radio configuration.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n   - The function takes no parameters.\n   - The function returns `RETURN_OK` if the rollback was successful, or `RETURN_ERR` if an error occurred.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**:\n   - The function uses the `wifi_apply_radio_config()` function, which is a RDK-specific function for applying radio configuration changes.\n   - The function also uses the `wifi_apply_radio_settings()` function, which is a RDK-specific function for applying radio settings changes.",
