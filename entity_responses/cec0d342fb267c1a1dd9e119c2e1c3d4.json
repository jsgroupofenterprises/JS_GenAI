  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe purpose of the events_CSItable_addrowhandler function in the CcspWifiAgent component is to handle the addition of a new row to the Device.WiFi.X_RDK_CSI table. This table is used to monitor the Channel State Information (CSI) data for Wi-Fi devices.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nWhen a new row is added to the Device.WiFi.X_RDK_CSI table, the events_CSItable_addrowhandler function is invoked to create a new event element and add it to the RDK event queue. The event element contains the name, index, and type of the event.\n\nThe function also creates a new CSI data element and adds it to the CSI entry queue. The CSI data element contains the CSI session number for the new row.\n\nOnce the event element and CSI data element have been created and added to the respective queues, the function creates a new CSI session using the CSI session number.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe events_CSItable_addrowhandler function interacts with the following components:\n\n- The RDK event queue: The function adds the new event element to the RDK event queue.\n- The CSI entry queue: The function adds the new CSI data element to the CSI entry queue.\n- The CSI session creation function: The function calls the CSI session creation function to create a new CSI session.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe important parameters of the events_CSItable_addrowhandler function are:\n\n- handle: The handle to the RDK bus.\n- tableName: The name of the table that the new row was added to.\n- aliasName: The alias name of the table that the new row was added to.\n- instNum: A pointer to the instance number of the new row.\n\nThe function returns RBUS_ERROR_SUCCESS if the operation was successful, or an RDK error code if the operation failed.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe events_CSItable_addrowhandler function uses the following RDK-related operations:\n\n- The RDK event queue.\n- The CSI entry queue.\n- The CSI session creation function.",
