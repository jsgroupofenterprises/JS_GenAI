  "response": "## Analysis of wifi_FastTransitionConfig_t Structure\n\n### 1. Purpose\n\nThe `wifi_FastTransitionConfig_t` structure defines configuration settings related to the IEEE 802.11r Fast Transition (FT) protocol. FT enables a Wi-Fi client to roam seamlessly between access points without needing to re-authenticate.\n\n### 2. Key Fields and Significance\n\n- `support`: Specifies whether FT is supported for a particular access point.\n- `mobilityDomain`: Identifies the Mobility Domain (MD) to which the access point belongs.\n- `overDS`: Indicates if FT is supported over a Distribution System (DS).\n- `r0KeyHolder`: Specifies the network entity that holds the R0 key.\n- `r0KeyLifeTime`: Defines the lifetime of the R0 key.\n- `r1KeyHolder`: Specifies the network entity that holds the R1 key.\n- `reassocDeadLine`: Defines the time within which a client must re-associate with an access point after initiating an FT exchange.\n- `pmkR1Push`: Indicates if the Pre-shared Master Key (PMK) will be pushed to the client.\n- `numR0KHs`/`numR1KHs`: Specifies the number of R0/R1 Key Holders (KHs) configured.\n- `r0KH`/`r1KH`: Arrays to store the R0/R1 KHs.\n\n### 3. Usage Context in RDK\n\nThe `wifi_FastTransitionConfig_t` structure is used to configure FT settings within the RDK Home Network Platform. It is typically defined in the RDK configuration database or provided by the access point driver.\n\n### 4. Related Components or Interfaces\n\n- **wifi_ft_mgr.c**: Implements the FT manager component, which handles FT-related operations.\n- **802.11r**: Provides the IEEE 802.11r protocol implementation.\n- **RADIUS**: Used for authentication and authorization of clients.\n\n### 5. Specific RDK-related Details\n\n- The maximum number of R0/R1 KHs supported in RDK is defined as `MAX_KEY_HOLDERS`.\n- The R0/R1 KHs can be configured using the RDK web interface or command-line tools.",
