  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `CosaWifiRegAddSsidInfo` function is responsible for registering a new SSID (Service Set Identifier) in the RDK database. It creates a new folder in the IREP (Intelligent Resource Eventing Protocol) tree and adds records for the SSID's name and next instance number.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n- It first checks if the IREP folder object for Wi-Fi SSID exists and is valid.\n- It then disables file synchronization for the SSID IREP folder to prevent any conflicts during the update process.\n- It increments the SSID's next instance number and stores it in the IREP tree.\n- It creates a new folder in the IREP tree for the specific SSID instance using the next instance number.\n- It adds a record for the SSID's name to the newly created folder.\n- Finally, it enables file synchronization for the SSID IREP folder again.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThis function interacts with the following components:\n\n- IREP: It uses the IREP API to create folders and add records to the RDK database.\n- SLAP: It uses the SLAP library to create and manipulate SLAP (Simple Lightweight Access Protocol) variables, which are used to represent data in IREP records.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n- **hThisObject:** Handle to the Wi-Fi data model object.\n- **hCosaContext:** Handle to the Cosa context, which contains information about the current instance of the Wi-Fi agent.\n- **returnStatus:** Indicates the success or failure of the operation.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\n- This function is specific to the RDK platform and is used to manage SSID information in the RDK database.",
