  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\n* The `WifiClient_Rollback` function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component in RDK and is used to handle rollback operations for the Wi-Fi client.\n* It resets the client reporting period to its default value.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n* The function takes an input parameter, `hInsContext`, which is an ANSC handle to the instance context.\n* The function retrieves the `PCOSA_DATAMODEL_WIFI` object from the `g_pCosaBEManager` global variable.\n* It then retrieves the `PCOSA_DML_WIFI_HARVESTER` object from the `pMyObject`'s `pHarvester` member.\n* If the `bINSTClientReportingPeriodChanged` flag in the harvester object is set to true, the function resets the `uINSTClientReportingPeriod` member of the harvester object to its default value and sets the `bINSTClientReportingPeriodChanged` flag to false.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\n* This function interacts with the CcspWifiAgent's data model to access the Wi-Fi harvester object.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* The function takes one parameter:\n    * `hInsContext`: ANSC handle to the instance context.\n* The function returns a ULONG value, which is 0 if the operation was successful.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\n* This function is specific to RDK and is used to handle rollback operations for the Wi-Fi client in the CcspWifiAgent component.",
