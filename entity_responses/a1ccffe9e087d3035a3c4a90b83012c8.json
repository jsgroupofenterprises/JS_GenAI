  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**\n   - The `blob_to_json` function in the `CcspWifiAgent` component of RDK is used to convert a binary data blob (in `msgpack` format) into a JSON string. The JSON string can be used for further processing or communication.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**\n   - The function takes a binary data blob in the form of a `msgpack_sbuffer` structure (`sbuf`) as input.\n   - It initializes a `msgpack_zone` structure (`z`) for memory management during the unpacking process.\n   - The function unpacks the input binary blob using the `msgpack_unpack` function and stores the result in a `msgpack_object` structure (`obj`).\n   - It then prints the `msgpack_object` as a JSON string into the provided buffer (`jsonparsed`).\n   - The function adds a null terminator to the JSON string and returns the length of the JSON string.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components**\n   - The `CcspWifiAgent` component handles Wi-Fi-related operations in RDK. The `blob_to_json` function is used internally within the component for converting binary data blobs to JSON strings.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**\n   - **`sbuf`**: A pointer to the `msgpack_sbuffer` structure containing the binary data blob.\n   - **`jsonparsed`**: A pointer to the buffer where the JSON string will be stored.\n   - **`jsonstrlen`**: The length of the provided buffer for storing the JSON string.\n   - **Return value**: The function returns `0` on success, indicating that the binary blob has been successfully converted to a JSON string.\n\n5. **Specific RDK-related operations**\n   - The function is part of the `CcspWifiAgent` component, which is specific to RDK, a software development kit for cable operator-grade devices.",
