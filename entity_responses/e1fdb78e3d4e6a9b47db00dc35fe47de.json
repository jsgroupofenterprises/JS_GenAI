  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n- This function retrieves a cached row from an OVSDB table using a provided key and copies the row's data into a provided record.\n- It is used to efficiently access and retrieve specific rows based on their keys from the OVSDB cache.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n- The function takes three parameters: an OVSDB table, a key, and a pointer to a record where the row's data will be copied.\n- It first calls ovsdb_cache_find_row_by_key() to find the row in the table that matches the provided key.\n- If the row is found, the function copies its data into the provided record using memcpy() and returns the record.\n- If the row is not found, the function returns NULL.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n- The function interacts with the OVSDB cache, which is a component that stores cached rows from OVSDB tables.\n- It uses the ovsdb_cache_find_row_by_key() function to find rows in the cache.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n- `table`: The OVSDB table to search for the row in.\n- `key`: The key of the row to retrieve.\n- `record`: A pointer to the record where the row's data will be copied.\n- The function returns the record containing the row's data if the row is found, or NULL if the row is not found.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n- The function is part of the CcspWifiAgent RDK component, which is responsible for managing Wi-Fi networks and devices in RDK-based devices.\n- It is specifically used to retrieve cached rows from the OVSDB tables used by the Wi-Fi agent.",
