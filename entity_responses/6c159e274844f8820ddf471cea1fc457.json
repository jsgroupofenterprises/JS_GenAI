  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe CosaDmlV6AddrIsEqual function compares two IPv6 addresses and returns 1 if they are equal, or 0 otherwise.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes two parameters, p_addr1 and p_addr2, which are pointers to the two IPv6 addresses to compare. It first checks if either of the pointers is NULL, and if so, returns 0.\n\nIf both pointers are non-NULL, the function calls the __v6addr_mismatch function to compare the two addresses. The __v6addr_mismatch function takes three parameters: the two addresses to compare, and a length parameter. The length parameter specifies the number of bits to compare in the addresses. In this case, the length parameter is 128, which is the full length of an IPv6 address.\n\nThe __v6addr_mismatch function returns a non-zero value if the two addresses are different, and 0 if they are the same. The CosaDmlV6AddrIsEqual function then returns the inverse of the value returned by __v6addr_mismatch.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe CosaDmlV6AddrIsEqual function does not interact with any other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe important parameters of the CosaDmlV6AddrIsEqual function are:\n\n* p_addr1: A pointer to the first IPv6 address to compare.\n* p_addr2: A pointer to the second IPv6 address to compare.\n\nThe return value of the CosaDmlV6AddrIsEqual function is:\n\n* 1 if the two addresses are equal.\n* 0 if the two addresses are not equal.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe CosaDmlV6AddrIsEqual function is not specific to RDK. It can be used in any application that needs to compare two IPv6 addresses.",
