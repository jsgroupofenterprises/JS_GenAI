It is used to retrieve the authentication credentials for a specific voice service, profile, and line.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes the following parameters:\n\n* `service`: The voice service for which to retrieve the credentials.\n* `profile`: The voice profile for which to retrieve the credentials.\n* `line`: The ATA line number for which to retrieve the credentials.\n* `eAuthCredential`: The type of credential to retrieve (e.g., username or password).\n* `pBuffer`: A pointer to a buffer to store the retrieved credential.\n* `pLength`: A pointer to a variable to store the length of the retrieved credential.\n\nThe function first validates the input parameters. If any of the parameters are invalid, the function returns an error code.\n\nIf the input parameters are valid, the function retrieves the credentials from the specified voice service, profile, and line. The credentials are stored in the provided buffer and the length of the credentials is stored in the provided variable.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `voice_hal_getAuthCredentials` function interacts with the following components:\n\n* The voice service provider. The function retrieves the credentials from the voice service provider.\n* The voice profile manager. The function uses the voice profile manager to determine the voice profile for the specified service and line.\n* The ATA line manager. The function uses the ATA line manager to determine the ATA line number for the specified service and profile.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following parameters and return values are important to note:\n\n* The `eAuthCredential` parameter must be one of the following values:\n    * `VoiceHalAuthCredentialType_eUserName`\n    * `VoiceHalAuthCredentialType_ePassword`\n* The `pBuffer` parameter must point to a buffer that is large enough to store the retrieved credential.\n* The `pLength` parameter must point to a variable that is large enough to store the length of the retrieved credential.\n* The function returns one of the following error codes:\n    * `RDK_SUCCESS`: The function completed successfully.\n    * `RDK_FAILURE`: The function failed to complete successfully.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `voice_hal_getAuthCredentials` function is an RDK-specific function.
