  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\nThe purpose of the `wifi_setBandSteeringPhyRateThreshold` function is to configure the threshold for band steering based on the PHY rate of the client device. When a client device is associated with the access point (AP) and its PHY rate falls below the specified threshold, the AP will attempt to steer the client device to the other band (either 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz) to improve performance.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\nThe function takes two parameters:\n* `radioIndex`: The index of the radio interface to configure.\n* `prThreshold`: The PHY rate threshold in Mbps.\n\nThe function first checks if the specified radio index is valid. If it is not, the function returns -1.\n\nIf the radio index is valid, the function sets the PHY rate threshold for the specified radio interface. The threshold is stored in the driver's configuration database.\n\nWhen a client device associates with the AP, the AP checks the client device's PHY rate. If the PHY rate is below the specified threshold, the AP will attempt to steer the client device to the other band.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\nThis function interacts with the following components:\n* The Wi-Fi driver: The function sets the PHY rate threshold in the driver's configuration database.\n* The AP: The AP uses the PHY rate threshold to determine when to steer client devices to a different band.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\nThe following parameters are important:\n* `radioIndex`: The index of the radio interface to configure.\n* `prThreshold`: The PHY rate threshold in Mbps.\n\nThe function returns 0 if successful. If the specified radio index is invalid, the function returns -1.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\nThis function is not specific to RDK. It is a generic Wi-Fi function that can be used in any Wi-Fi system.",
