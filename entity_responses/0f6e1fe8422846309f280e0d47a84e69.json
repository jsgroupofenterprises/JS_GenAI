  "response": "## Main purpose and functionality\n\nThe purpose of the `upload_single_client_active_msmt_data` function is to upload a single client active measurement data to the network management system (NMS). This data is collected by the Wi-Fi agent and is used to monitor the performance of the Wi-Fi network.\n\n## Key operations and data flow\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n* `bssid_info`: A pointer to a `bssid_data_t` structure that contains information about the BSSID of the access point (AP) to which the client is connected.\n* `sta_info`: A pointer to a `sta_data_t` structure that contains information about the client.\n\nThe function first checks if the `sta_info` parameter is `NULL`. If it is, then the function assumes that the measurement data is for all clients associated with the AP specified by the `bssid_info` parameter. Otherwise, the function assumes that the measurement data is for the specific client specified by the `sta_info` parameter.\n\nThe function then opens a schema file that contains the Avro schema for the active measurement data. The Avro schema is used to validate the data before it is sent to the NMS.\n\nOnce the schema file is opened, the function creates an Avro writer object. The writer object is used to write the active measurement data to a buffer.\n\nThe function then creates an Avro value object. The value object is used to store the active measurement data.\n\nThe function then populates the value object with the active measurement data. The data includes:\n\n* A timestamp\n* The transaction ID\n* The schema version\n* The plan ID\n* The CPE MAC address\n* The client MAC address\n* The sampling interval\n* The packet size\n* The blast metrics, which include:\n    * The noise floor\n    * The channel utilization\n    * The activity factor\n    * The carrier sense threshold exceeded\n    * The channels in use\n    * The operating standard\n    * The operating channel bandwidth\n    * The channel number\n    * The frequency band\n    * The TX retransmissions\n    * The max TX rate\n    * The max RX rate\n* The array of device reports, which includes:\n    * The signal strength\n    * The SNR\n    * The TX phy rate\n    * The RX phy rate\n    * The throughput\n* The CPU health metrics, which include:\n    * The CPU usage\n    * The memory usage\n    * The load average\n\nOnce the value object is populated, the function writes the data to the buffer using the writer object.\n\nFinally, the function closes the schema file and the writer object, and sends the buffer to the NMS.\n\n## Interaction with other components\n\nThe `upload_single_client_active_msmt_data` function interacts with the following components:\n\n* The Wi-Fi agent: The Wi-Fi agent collects the active measurement data and passes it to the function.\n* The network management system (NMS): The NMS receives the active measurement data from the function and uses it to monitor the performance of the Wi-Fi network.\n\n## Important parameters and return values\n\nThe `upload_single_client_active_msmt_data` function has the following important parameters:\n\n* `bssid_info`: A pointer to a `bssid_data_t` structure that contains information about the BSSID of the AP to which the client is connected.\n* `sta_info`: A pointer to a `sta_data_t` structure that contains information about the client.\n\nThe function does not return any values.\n\n## Specific RDK-related operations\n\nThe `upload_single_client_active_msmt_data` function uses the following RDK-related operations:\n\n* The `sendWebpaMsg` function is used to send the active measurement data to the NMS.",
