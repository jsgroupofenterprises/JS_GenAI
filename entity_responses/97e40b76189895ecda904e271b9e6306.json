  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `events_deinit` function is responsible for cleaning up the resources allocated by the CcspWifiAgent component during its lifetime. It does this by releasing any acquired locks, closing connections, and freeing any allocated memory.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function first checks if the Rbus service is available. If it is not, the function returns immediately. Otherwise, the function proceeds to acquire the `g_events_lock` mutex to prevent concurrent access to shared resources.\n\nThe function then loops through the `g_rbus_events_queue` queue and pops each element from the queue. Each element is then freed. The function also destroys the `g_rbus_events_queue` queue and closes the `g_rbus_handle` connection.\n\nFinally, the function unlocks the `g_events_lock` mutex and destroys it.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `events_deinit` function interacts with the following components:\n\n* The Rbus service: The function uses the Rbus service to communicate with the CcspWifiAgent component.\n* The CcspWifiAgent component: The function uses the CcspWifiAgent component to acquire and release the `g_events_lock` mutex and to close the `g_rbus_handle` connection.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe `events_deinit` function does not take any parameters and returns a value of 0 if successful.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `events_deinit` function uses the following RDK-specific APIs:\n\n* `rbus_close`: The function uses this API to close the connection to the Rbus service.\n* `get_csi_entry_queue`: The function uses this API to retrieve the CSI entry queue.",
