  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `assoc_req_frame_received` function is a callback function that is called when an association request frame is received by the CcspWifiAgent component. The purpose of this function is to process the association request frame and send an association response frame to the requesting station.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes the following parameters:\n\n* `ap_index`: The index of the access point that received the association request frame.\n* `sta`: The MAC address of the station that sent the association request frame.\n* `data`: A pointer to the association request frame data.\n* `len`: The length of the association request frame data.\n\nThe function first checks if the station is already associated with the access point. If the station is already associated, the function ignores the association request frame.\n\nIf the station is not already associated with the access point, the function checks if the station is authorized to associate with the access point. If the station is not authorized, the function sends a disassociation frame to the station.\n\nIf the station is authorized, the function sends an association response frame to the station.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe function interacts with the following components:\n\n* The CcspWifiAgent component: The function is called by the CcspWifiAgent component when an association request frame is received.\n* The wireless driver: The function sends an association response frame to the station using the wireless driver.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following parameters are important:\n\n* `ap_index`: The index of the access point that received the association request frame. This parameter is used to identify the access point that is responsible for processing the association request frame.\n* `sta`: The MAC address of the station that sent the association request frame. This parameter is used to identify the station that is requesting association.\n* `data`: A pointer to the association request frame data. This parameter contains the data that is included in the association request frame.\n* `len`: The length of the association request frame data. This parameter specifies the length of the data that is included in the association request frame.\n\nThe function does not return a value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe function does not perform any RDK-specific operations.",
