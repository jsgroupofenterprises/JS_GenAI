  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `ticks()` function is a time-related function that returns the current time in milliseconds since the system was booted. This function is used by various components in RDK to measure the time taken for different operations or to schedule tasks.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe `ticks()` function internally calls the `clock_ticks()` function to retrieve the current time from the hardware clock. The `clock_ticks()` function takes a clock ID as a parameter, which specifies the clock to use for the time measurement. In this function, it uses the `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` clock ID, which provides a monotonically increasing time value that is not affected by system time adjustments.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `ticks()` function is typically used by other components in RDK to measure the time taken for different operations or to schedule tasks. For example, it can be used by a component that monitors the performance of the system to track the time taken for a specific task to complete.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe `ticks()` function does not take any parameters. It returns a 64-bit integer representing the current time in milliseconds since the system was booted.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `ticks()` function does not perform any RDK-specific operations. It is a generic time-related function that can be used by any component in the RDK system.",
