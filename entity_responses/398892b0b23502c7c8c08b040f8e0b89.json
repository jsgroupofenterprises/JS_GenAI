  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n- The clock_ticks() function retrieves the current timestamp in nanoseconds monoticically increasing, from a specified clock.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n- Retrieve the current timestamp by calling clock_gettime() function.\n- Convert the timestamp from timespec to ticks using timespec_to_ticks() function.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components:**\n- Uses the timespec_to_ticks() function, which is part of the CcspWifiAgent component.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n- clk: The clock ID to retrieve the timestamp from.\n- Returns: A 64-bit integer representing the current timestamp in nanoseconds monotonic increasing.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n- No RDK-specific operations are performed in this function.",
