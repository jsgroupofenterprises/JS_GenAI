  "response": "## DPP Functions\n\n**Main purpose and Functionality**\n\nDevice Provisioning Protocol (DPP) is a Wi-Fi Alliance standard that simplifies the process of adding new devices to a Wi-Fi network. DPP uses a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi to securely provision devices without the need for manual entry of passwords.\n\n**Key operations and data flow**\n\nDPP works by establishing a secure connection between the new device and the existing Wi-Fi network. This connection is used to exchange security credentials and other configuration information. The following is a simplified overview of the DPP process:\n\n1. The new device broadcasts its presence using BLE.\n2. The existing Wi-Fi network responds to the broadcast and establishes a secure connection with the new device.\n3. The new device sends its security credentials to the existing Wi-Fi network.\n4. The existing Wi-Fi network verifies the security credentials of the new device.\n5. The existing Wi-Fi network sends the new device its configuration information.\n6. The new device connects to the existing Wi-Fi network using the configuration information it received.\n\n**Interaction with other components**\n\nDPP interacts with the following components:\n\n* Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE): DPP uses BLE to establish a secure connection between the new device and the existing Wi-Fi network.\n* Wi-Fi: DPP uses Wi-Fi to exchange security credentials and other configuration information between the new device and the existing Wi-Fi network.\n* Wi-Fi Alliance: DPP is a Wi-Fi Alliance standard.\n\n**Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following are some of the important parameters and return values used by DPP functions:\n\n* **wifi_dppSetSTAPassphrase:**\n    * **Parameters:**\n        * apIndex: The index of the access point.\n        * sta: The MAC address of the new device.\n        * key: The passphrase for the new device.\n    * **Return value:**\n        * RETURN_OK if successful.\n        * RETURN_ERR if an error occurred.\n* **wifi_dppRemoveSTAPassphrase:**\n    * **Parameters:**\n        * apIndex: The index of the access point.\n        * sta: The MAC address of the new device.\n    * **Return value:**\n        * RETURN_OK if successful.\n        * RETURN_ERR if an error occurred.\n\n**Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThere are no specific RDK-related operations for DPP.",
