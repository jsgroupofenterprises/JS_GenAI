  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `ovsdb_cache_get_by_key2` function in CcspWifiAgent retrieves a record from a cached OVSDB table by providing a key.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n* The function takes three parameters:\n    * `table`: A pointer to the table from which the record is to be retrieved.\n    * `key2`: A pointer to the key by which the record is to be retrieved.\n    * `record`: A pointer to the memory location where the retrieved record will be stored.\n* The function first calls `ovsdb_cache_find_row_by_key2` to find the row that corresponds to the given key.\n* If a row is found, the function copies the record from the row into the memory location specified by `record`.\n* If no row is found, the function sets the memory location specified by `record` to 0.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `ovsdb_cache_get_by_key2` function interacts with the following components:\n\n* `ovsdb_cache_find_row_by_key2`: This function finds the row that corresponds to the given key.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* The `table` parameter must be a pointer to a valid OVSDB table.\n* The `key2` parameter must be a pointer to a valid string.\n* The `record` parameter must be a pointer to a memory location that is large enough to store the retrieved record.\n* The function returns a pointer to the retrieved record, or NULL if no row is found.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `ovsdb_cache_get_by_key2` function is specific to RDK (Reference Design Kit) and is used to retrieve data from OVSDB (Open vSwitch Database).",
