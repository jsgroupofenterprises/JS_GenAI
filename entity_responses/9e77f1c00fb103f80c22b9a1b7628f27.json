  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - The `qm_res_valid` function in the CcspWifiAgent component checks the validity of a qm_response_t structure, which is commonly used for receiving responses from the qm (queue manager) in RDK.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n   - The function receives a pointer to a qm_response_t structure as input.\n   - It checks if the `tag` field of the response matches the predefined QM_RESPONSE_TAG and if the `ver` field matches the QM_RESPONSE_VER.\n   - If both checks pass, the function returns true, indicating a valid response; otherwise, it returns false.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n   - This function interacts with the qm (queue manager) component to validate responses received from the queue.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n   - **Parameters:**\n     - `res`: Pointer to a qm_response_t structure.\n   - **Return value:**\n     - Returns true if the response is valid; false otherwise.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n   - The function uses predefined RDK-specific constants for tag and version validation (QM_RESPONSE_TAG and QM_RESPONSE_VER). These constants ensure that the function works correctly within the RDK environment.",
