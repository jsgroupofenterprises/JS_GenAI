  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**: The `timeval_to_ticks` function converts a `timeval` structure, which represents a time interval, to the number of ticks since a certain epoch.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**: The function takes a pointer to a `timeval` structure as input. It then calculates the number of ticks since the epoch by multiplying the number of seconds in the `timeval` structure by the number of ticks per second (`TICKS_S`) and adding the number of microseconds in the `timeval` structure multiplied by the number of ticks per microsecond (`TICKS_US`). The result is returned as an `int64_t`.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components**: This function is not directly interacting with other components.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**: \n * `tv`: A pointer to a `timeval` structure representing the time interval to be converted.\n * `return`: The number of ticks since the epoch, represented as an `int64_t`.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**: This function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component in RDK and is used to convert timestamps from the `timeval` format to the number of ticks since the epoch. This is useful for tracking time intervals and performing time-based calculations in the RDK environment.",
