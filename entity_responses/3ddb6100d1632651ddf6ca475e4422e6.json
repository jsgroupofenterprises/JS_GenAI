  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:** \nThe main purpose of voice_hal_setEnablePrackRequired function is to set the enable/disable state of the PRACK required flag for a given voice service and profile. PRACK (Provisional Response ACKnowledgement) is used in SIP to ensure reliable delivery of provisional responses. By enabling the PRACK required flag, the CPE indicates that it requires a PRACK for any provisional responses received. This helps to prevent call setup failures due to lost or delayed provisional responses.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:** \nThe function takes four input parameters: service, profile, enablePrackRequired, of which service and profile are used to identify the specific voice service and profile for which the PRACK required flag needs to be set. The enablePrackRequired parameter is a boolean value that specifies whether the PRACK required flag should be enabled (true) or disabled (false). The function sets the PRACK required flag accordingly and returns a status code indicating the success or failure of the operation.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):** \nThis function interacts with the SIP stack and the underlying telephony hardware to set the PRACK required flag.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:** \nThe important parameters of this function are:\n- service: The voice service for which the PRACK required flag needs to be set.\n- profile: The voice profile that is associated with the service and for which the PRACK required flag needs to be set.\n- enablePrackRequired: A boolean value that specifies whether the PRACK required flag should be enabled (true) or disabled (false).\nThe function returns a status code indicating the success or failure of the operation. A status code of RDK_SUCCESS indicates that the operation was successful, while a status code of RDK_FAILURE indicates that the operation failed.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:** \nThis function uses the RDK voice HAL API to set the PRACK required flag.",
