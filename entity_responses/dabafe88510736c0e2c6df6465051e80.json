  "response": "### 1. Main purpose and functionality:\n   - **mon_install_parent_signals** is a function that sets the signal handling for the parent process of the \"OneWifi\" component in RDK. It modifies the behavior of the process when receiving specific signals, such as SIGINT (interrupt) and SIGTERM (termination).\n\n### 2. Key operations and data flow:\n   - Initializes a `sigaction` structure `sa` with empty signal mask and sets the signal handler to `mon_sig_forward` for SIGINT and SIGTERM signals.\n   - Ignores SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 by setting their signal handler to SIG_IGN.\n   - Updates the signal action for SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGUSR1, and SIGUSR2 signals using `sigaction()`.\n\n### 3. Interaction with other components (if any):\n   - This function is typically called during the initialization of the OneWifi component. It does not interact directly with any other specific RDK components.\n\n### 4. Important parameters and return values:\n   - None\n\n### 5. Any specific RDK-related operations:\n   - `mon_install_parent_signals` uses standard C library functions, such as `sigemptyset` and `sigaction`, which are commonly used in RDK codebase for signal handling.",
