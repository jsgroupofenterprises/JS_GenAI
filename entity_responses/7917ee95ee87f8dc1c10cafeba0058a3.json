  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `wifi_passpoint_dbg_print` function is used for debugging purposes in the CcspWifiAgent component of RDK. It prints a formatted string to a file named `/tmp/wifiPasspoint`. This file can be used to diagnose issues with the Wi-Fi Passpoint feature.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes a format string and a variable number of arguments. It uses `va_start` and `va_end` to iterate through the arguments and format the string using `vsprintf`. The formatted string is then appended to a buffer, which is written to the file `/tmp/wifiPasspoint`.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe function does not directly interact with any other components. However, the file `/tmp/wifiPasspoint` can be read by other components to obtain debugging information.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe function takes a single parameter, which is a format string. The format string specifies the format of the formatted string that will be printed to the file. The function does not return any value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe function uses the RDK-specific `get_formatted_time` function to get the current time in a formatted string. This function is used to add a timestamp to the formatted string that is printed to the file.",
