  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `qm_conn_write_res` function in CcspWifiAgent writes a `qm_response_t` structure to a file descriptor. This structure typically contains the response to a request that was sent to the QM component.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n- `fd`: The file descriptor to write to.\n- `res`: A pointer to the `qm_response_t` structure to write.\n\na. The function first calculates the size of the `qm_response_t` structure using `sizeof(*res)`.\nb. It then uses the `write` function to write the structure to the file descriptor.\nc. If the number of bytes written is not equal to the size of the structure, the function logs an error and returns `false`.\nd. If the write is successful, the function logs a trace message and returns `true`.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\n- This function interacts with the QM component, which is responsible for managing connections.\n- QM component sends requests to the CcspWifiAgent, which handles the requests and sends back a response using this function.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n- `fd`: The file descriptor to write to. This file descriptor is typically connected to the QM component.\n- `res`: A pointer to the `qm_response_t` structure to write. This structure contains the response to the request.\n- The function returns `true` if the write is successful and `false` otherwise.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\n- The function uses the RDK logging macros to log errors and trace messages.\n- The function uses the RDK `write` function to write the data to the file descriptor.",
