  "response": "## RDK Function Analysis: platform\\_hal\\_GetHardware\n\n**Purpose and Functionality:**\n\nThe `platform_hal_GetHardware` function is a generic function for retrieving hardware information from the device. It provides various sub-functions for specific hardware parameters, such as memory usage, factory reset count, time offset, and firmware image status.\n\n**Key Operations and Data Flow:**\n\n1. The caller provides a pointer to a character buffer (`pValue`) where the requested hardware information will be returned.\n2. The function determines which sub-function to invoke based on the specified parameter.\n3. The corresponding sub-function retrieves the hardware information and stores it in the provided buffer.\n4. The function returns a status indicating the success or failure of the operation.\n\n**Interaction with Other Components:**\n\nThis function primarily interacts with hardware components to retrieve the requested information.\n\n**Important Parameters and Return Values:**\n\n* **pValue:** A pointer to a character buffer where the hardware information will be returned. The size of this buffer should be large enough to accommodate the returned data.\n* **Return Value:** The function returns `RETURN_OK` on success and `RETURN_ERR` if any error occurs during the operation.\n\n**RDK-Related Operations:**\n\nSeveral sub-functions of `platform_hal_GetHardware` are specifically designed to retrieve RDK-related hardware parameters, such as:\n\n* `platform_hal_GetFactoryResetCount`: Retrieves the number of factory resets performed on the device.\n* `platform_hal_ClearResetCount`: Resets the factory reset count on the device.\n* `platform_hal_getTimeOffSet`: Retrieves the time offset from the device.\n* `platform_hal_SetDeviceCodeImageTimeout`: Sets the hardware watchdog timeout value.\n* `platform_hal_SetDeviceCodeImageValid`: Sets the valid flag for the firmware image flashed on the device.\n* `platform_hal_getFactoryPartnerId`: Retrieves the factory partner ID from the device.\n* `platform_hal_getFactoryCmVariant`: Retrieves the factory CM variant from the device.\n* `platform_hal_setFactoryCmVariant`: Sets the factory CM variant on the device.",
