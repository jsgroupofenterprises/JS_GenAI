  "response": "## Function Analysis\n\n### 1. Main Purpose and Functionality\n\nThe `strargv()` function parses a command line string into individual argument strings, similar to the `argv` array in C programs. It supports handling spaces, quotes, and escaped characters within the command line.\n\n### 2. Key Operations and Data Flow\n\n- Iterates through the command line string character by character, transitioning between states based on the current character:\n  - TOK_SPACE: Skips whitespace.\n  - TOK_WORD: Copies non-whitespace characters.\n  - TOK_QUOTE: Copies quoted characters.\n  - TOK_END: Reached the end of the command line.\n- Escapes escaped characters and handles quoted strings.\n- Advances the pointer to the next unparsed character in the command line.\n\n### 3. Interaction with Other Components (if any)\n\nThis function operates independently and does not interact with other components.\n\n### 4. Important Parameters and Return Values\n\n- **cmd**: Pointer to the command line string to be parsed.\n- **with_quotes**: Boolean value indicating whether the function should maintain quoted strings or not.\n- **retval**: Pointer to the original command line string.\n\n### 5. Any Specific RDK-related Operations\n\nThis function does not perform any RDK-specific operations.",
