  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `wifi_del_mac_handler` function is implemented in the CcspWifiAgent component of the RDK. It is called as part of the greylisting cache timeout functionality, which involves managing a list of MAC addresses that are grey listed, meaning they are allowed to connect to the network but are monitored for suspicious activity.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n* The function takes two parameters:\n    * `eloop_ctx`: A pointer to the eloop context.\n    * `timeout_ctx`: A pointer to the timeout context.\n* The function first calls the `os_zalloc` function to allocate memory for a new `greylist_mac` structure.\n* It then parses the timeout context to get the MAC address of the client that is being removed from the greylist.\n* The function then calls the `wifi_add_mac_handler` function to add the MAC address to the greylist.\n* Finally, the function calls the `eloop_register_timeout` function to register a timeout for the client. The timeout is set to 24 hours, which is the amount of time that the client is allowed to remain on the greylist.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `wifi_del_mac_handler` function interacts with the following components:\n* The eloop event loop.\n* The CcspWifiAgent component.\n* The greylist cache.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe `wifi_del_mac_handler` function takes two parameters: `eloop_ctx` and `timeout_ctx`. The `eloop_ctx` parameter is a pointer to the eloop context, and the `timeout_ctx` parameter is a pointer to the timeout context. The function does not return any value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `wifi_del_mac_handler` function uses the following RDK-specific operations:\n* The `os_zalloc` function to allocate memory for a new `greylist_mac` structure.\n* The `wifi_add_mac_handler` function to add a MAC address to the greylist.\n* The `eloop_register_timeout` function to register a timeout for a client.",
