It takes an OVSDB socket path, table name, and a JSON object representing the where clause as parameters.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n1. The function first logs the table name and where clause to the debug log.\n2. It then creates a JSON-RPC request to delete records from the specified table with the given where clause.\n3. The request is sent to the OVSDB server using the specified socket path, and the response is received.\n4. The function parses the response to get the number of records that were deleted.\n5. If no records were deleted, a warning is logged.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe function interacts with the OVSDB server using the NETCONF protocol.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* **ovsdb_sock_path:** The path to the OVSDB socket.\n* **table:** The name of the table to delete records from.\n* **where:** A JSON object representing the where clause.\n* **Return value:** The number of records that were deleted.\n\n**5.
