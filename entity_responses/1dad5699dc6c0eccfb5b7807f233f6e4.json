  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe function `hapd_reload_wps_config` is used to reload the WPS configuration for a specific access point. It handles changing various WPS-related parameters and updating the hostapd configuration accordingly. The function is typically called when the WPS configuration is modified through the RDK API.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n- The function starts by validating the input parameters and retrieving the hostapd data for the specified access point.\n- If WPS was previously enabled on the access point, the function sends de-authentication packets to all connected stations to force them to reconnect.\n- Based on the configuration parameter specified, the function updates the WPS state, configuration methods, and push button settings in the hostapd configuration.\n- If WPS was previously enabled and is now being disabled, the function deinitializes WPS for the access point.\n- If WPS was not previously enabled and is now being enabled, the function initializes WPS for the access point.\n- Finally, the function updates the beacon frames to reflect the new WPS configuration.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\n- The function interacts with the hostapd library to manage the WPS configuration and beacon frames.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n- `apIndex`: Index of the access point for which the WPS configuration is being reloaded.\n- `configParam`: Configuration parameter that is being modified.\n- `wpsState`: New WPS state (configured or not configured).\n- `ConfigMethodsEnabled`: Bitmask of WPS configuration methods that are enabled.\n- `WpsPushButton`: Push button status.\n- Return value: 0 on success, -1 on failure.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\n- The function uses RDK-specific functions to set WPS-related parameters, such as `wifi_setApWpsEnable` and `wifi_setApWpsConfigMethodsEnabled`.",
