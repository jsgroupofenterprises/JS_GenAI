  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - The `process_auth_packet` function processes 802.1X authentication frames for Wi-Fi connections.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n   - Receives an `auth_data` structure containing authentication frame data and a `module` pointer.\n   - Calls the `hapd_process_auth_frame` function to process the frame using the Host Access Point daemon (HAPD).\n   - Frees the allocated memory used for the `auth_data` structure.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components:**\n   - The function interacts with the HAPD, a daemon for managing wireless access points.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n   - `auth_data`: A pointer to a structure containing authentication frame data, including the frame data itself, the MAC address of the transmitting device, the direction of the frame, and the length of the frame.\n   - `module`: A pointer to a `wifi_8021x_t` structure, but it is not actually used in the function.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n   - `process_auth_packet` is part of the RDK's CcspWifiAgent component, which manages Wi-Fi connections on RDK devices.",
