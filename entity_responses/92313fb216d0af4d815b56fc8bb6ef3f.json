  "response": "**1. Purpose of this structure:**\n\nThe `dhcpv4c_ip_list_t` structure is used to represent a list of IPv4 addresses that are related to a specific DHCPv4 component.\n\n**2. Key fields and their significance:**\n\n* **number**: This field indicates the number of IPv4 addresses that are included in the list.\n* **addrs**: This array contains the IPv4 addresses themselves. The maximum number of IPv4 addresses that can be included in the list is defined by the constant `DHCPV4_MAX_IPV4_ADDRS`.\n\n**3. Usage context in RDK:**\n\nThis structure is typically used in the RDK components that are responsible for managing DHCPv4. For example, the `dhcpv4c` component uses the `dhcpv4c_ip_list_t` structure to store the list of IP addresses that are available for lease.\n\n**4. Related components or interfaces:**\n\nThe following components or interfaces are related to the `dhcpv4c_ip_list_t` structure:\n\n* `dhcpv4c`: This component is responsible for managing DHCPv4.\n* `dhcpv4_ip_addr_t`: This structure is used to represent a single IPv4 address.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related details:**\n\nThe `dhcpv4c_ip_list_t` structure is a part of the RDK HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer). The HAL is a set of interfaces that are designed to provide a consistent way to access the hardware on different RDK-based devices.",
