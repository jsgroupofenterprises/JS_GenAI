Main purpose and functionality**\n\n- This function is an event handler that processes events related to the enabling and disabling of CSI (Channel State Information) sessions.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n- The function takes three parameters:\n    - `handle`: The RDK bus handle.\n    - `event`: The RDK event.\n    - `subscription`: The RDK event subscription.\n- The function first checks if the event is valid and if it matches the expected format.\n- If the event is valid, the function retrieves the value of the \"value\" property from the event data.\n- The function then logs the change in CSI session enable status and prints it to debug logs.\n\n**3.
