  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe purpose of this RDK function CcspHalEthSwGetPortCfg is to retrieve the current port configuration, including the link rate and duplex mode, for a specified port on an Ethernet switch.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe key operations and data flow of CcspHalEthSwGetPortCfg are as follows:\n\n- The function takes three input parameters:\n - PortId: The ID of the port for which the configuration is to be retrieved.\n - pLinkRate: A pointer to a variable to receive the link rate.\n - pDuplexMode: A pointer to a variable to receive the duplex mode.\n- The function queries the Ethernet switch to retrieve the current configuration for the specified port.\n- The function returns the link rate and duplex mode in the output parameters.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nCcspHalEthSwGetPortCfg interacts with the following components:\n\n- The Ethernet switch driver.\n- The CCSP HAL.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe important parameters and return values of CcspHalEthSwGetPortCfg are as follows:\n\n- Input parameters:\n - PortId: The ID of the port for which the configuration is to be retrieved.\n - pLinkRate: A pointer to a variable to receive the link rate.\n - pDuplexMode: A pointer to a variable to receive the duplex mode.\n- Return value: The function returns RETURN_OK if successful, or RETURN_ERR if an error occurs.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nCcspHalEthSwGetPortCfg is a specific RDK-related operation because it is used by the CCSP HAL to retrieve the current port configuration for an Ethernet switch.",
