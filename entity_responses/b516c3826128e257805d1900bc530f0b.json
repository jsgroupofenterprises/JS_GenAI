  "response": "## **Analysis of WifiClient_ActiveMeasurements_Rollback**\n\n### 1. Main purpose and functionality\n\nThe WifiClient_ActiveMeasurements_Rollback function in the CcspWifiAgent component allows the rollback of changes to active measurement settings such as sample duration, packet size, and the number of samples. It ensures that any unsaved modifications to these settings are reverted to their previous values.\n\n### 2. Key operations and data flow\n\n- The function checks if the active measurement sample duration has been changed. If so, it resets it to the old value stored in the 'uActiveMsmtOldSampleDuration' member of the 'pHarvester' object.\n- It then checks if the active measurement packet size has been changed. If so, it resets it to the old value stored in the 'uActiveMsmtOldPktSize' member of the 'pHarvester' object.\n- Finally, it checks if the active measurement number of samples has been changed. If so, it resets it to the old value stored in the 'uActiveMsmtOldNumberOfSamples' member of the 'pHarvester' object.\n- All changes to the 'bActiveMsmtSampleDurationChanged', 'bActiveMsmtPktSizeChanged', and 'bActiveMsmtNumberOfSamplesChanged' flags are set to false.\n\n### 3. Interaction with other components (if any)\n\nThe function operates on the 'pHarvester' object of the 'pMyObject' structure, which holds the active measurement harvester data for the Wi-Fi interface. This object is managed by the 'COSA_DATAMODEL_WIFI' module, which is responsible for managing Wi-Fi-related data and settings.\n\n### 4. Important parameters and return values\n\n- **hInsContext**: Input parameter representing the handle to the instance of the component. It is not used in this function.\n- **Return value**: The function returns a ULONG value indicating the status of the rollback operation. A value of 0 is returned upon successful rollback.\n\n### 5. Any specific RDK-related operations\n\nThis function is part of the RDK Wi-Fi Agent and is specifically used for managing active measurement settings.",
