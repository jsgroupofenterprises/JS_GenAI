  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe assoc_req_frame_received function is responsible for handling an Association Request (Assoc Req) frame received by the Wi-Fi Agent. It encapsulates the received Assoc Req frame and pushes it into a data queue for further processing.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n- The function takes four parameters:\n    - `ap_index`: The index of the Access Point (AP) that received the Assoc Req frame.\n    - `sta`: The MAC address of the Station (STA) that sent the Assoc Req frame.\n    - `data`: A pointer to the received Assoc Req frame data.\n    - `len`: The length of the received Assoc Req frame data.\n- It allocates memory for a new `wifi_assoc_req_data_t` structure, which will hold the received Assoc Req frame data, its length, and other relevant information.\n- It copies the received Assoc Req frame data into the allocated memory.\n- It sets the `vap` field of the `wifi_assoc_req_data_t` structure to the AP index.\n- It copies the STA's MAC address into the `mac` field of the `wifi_assoc_req_data_t` structure.\n- It creates a data plane packet using the `data_plane_queue_create_packet` function and pushes the packet into the data plane queue using the `data_plane_queue_push` function.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components:**\n\n- The data plane queue is used to buffer the encapsulated Assoc Req frame.\n- Other components in the Wi-Fi Agent, such as the Association State Machine (ASM), will retrieve and process the Assoc Req frame from the data plane queue.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n- The `ap_index` and `sta` parameters identify the AP and STA involved in the Assoc Req frame, respectively.\n- The `data` and `len` parameters contain the received Assoc Req frame data and its length, respectively.\n- The `wifi_assoc_req_data_t` is the key data structure used to encapsulate the received Assoc Req frame data.\n- The function does not have a specific return value as it is declared as `void`.\n\n**5. Specific RDK-related operations:**\n\n- The data plane queue and data plane packet are RDK-specific constructs used for managing data flow between different Wi-Fi Agent components.",
