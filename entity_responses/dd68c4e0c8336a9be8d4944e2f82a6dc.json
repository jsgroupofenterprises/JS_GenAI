  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `os_nif_macaddr` function retrieves the MAC (hardware) address of a specified network interface.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function performs the following key operations:\n\n* Calls the `os_nif_ifreq` function with the `SIOCGIFHWADDR` request to retrieve the hardware address of the specified interface.\n* Copies the retrieved address into the provided `mac` parameter.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe function interacts with the kernel through the `ioctl` system call, which is used to send control requests to the kernel device drivers.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* **ifname:** The name of the network interface for which the MAC address is to be retrieved.\n* **mac:** A pointer to a structure where the retrieved MAC address will be stored.\n* **Return value:** The function returns `true` if the MAC address was successfully retrieved, and `false` otherwise.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
