Main Purpose and Functionality\n\nThe `ovsdb_delete_with_parent_s` function in the CcspWifiAgent component of RDK is used to delete a record from an OVSDB table based on a specified condition and a parent record.\n\n### 2. Key Operations and Data Flow\n\n- The function takes in the following parameters:\n  - `ovsdb_sock_path`: The path to the OVSDB socket.\n  - `table`: The name of the OVSDB table to delete from.\n  - `where`: A JSON object representing the condition to match for deletion.\n  - `parent_table`: The name of the parent OVSDB table.\n  - `parent_where`: A JSON object representing the condition to match for the parent record.\n  - `parent_column`: The name of the column in the parent table to use for matching.\n- The function constructs an OVSDB request using the provided parameters and sends it to the OVSDB server.\n- The OVSDB server processes the request and returns a response.\n- The function parses the response and returns a boolean indicating the success of the operation.\n\n### 3. Interaction with Other Components\n\nThe function interacts with the OVSDB server to perform the delete operation.\n\n### 4. Important Parameters and Return Values\n\n- **Parameters:**\n  - `ovsdb_sock_path`: The path to the OVSDB socket is essential for establishing a connection to the OVSDB server.\n  - `table`: The name of the OVSDB table to delete from determines the target of the operation.\n  - `where`: The JSON object representing the condition to match for deletion defines the criteria for selecting the record to be removed.\n  - `parent_table`: The name of the parent OVSDB table is necessary for performing the parent-based deletion.\n  - `parent_where`: The JSON object representing the condition to match for the parent record helps identify the parent record associated with the child record to be deleted.\n  - `parent_column`: The name of the column in the parent table to use for matching specifies the field that links the parent and child records.\n- **Return Value:**\n  - The function returns a boolean indicating the success of the delete operation. `true` is returned on successful deletion, and `false` is returned otherwise.\n\n### 5. Specific RDK-Related Operations\n\nThis function is part of the RDK's OVSDB integration, facilitating the management and configuration of network devices and services using OVSDB. It enables the deletion of records from OVSDB tables while considering the relationships with parent records, which is a common operation in RDK's network management scenarios.",
