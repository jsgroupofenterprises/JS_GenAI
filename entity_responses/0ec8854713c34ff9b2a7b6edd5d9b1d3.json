  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n    * The `wifi_getFTR1KeyHolderID` function retrieves the Fast Transition R1 (FTR1) Key Holder ID value for the specified access point (AP).\n    * FTR1 is a mechanism that allows a wireless client to quickly reconnect to an AP after roaming without having to go through the full authentication process.\n    * The key holder ID is a unique identifier for the device that is responsible for generating and distributing the Fast Transition Information (FTI) keys.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n    * The function takes two parameters:\n        * `apIndex` - The index of the AP for which the key holder ID is being retrieved.\n        * `keyHolderID` - A pointer to a buffer where the FTR1 key holder ID will be stored. The buffer must be at least 6 bytes long.\n    * The function retrieves the key holder ID from the AP's configuration and stores it in the provided buffer.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n    * This function does not directly interact with any other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n    * **Input parameters:**\n        * `apIndex` - The index of the AP for which the key holder ID is being retrieved.\n    * **Output parameters:**\n        * `keyHolderID` - A pointer to a buffer where the FTR1 key holder ID will be stored.\n    * **Return value:**\n        * The function returns `RETURN_OK` if the operation is successful, or `RETURN_ERR` if an error is detected.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n    * This function is not specific to RDK.",
