  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - The `wifi_get_initial_common_config` function retrieves the initial GAS (Generic Advertisement Service) configuration from the CcspWifiAgent component.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n   - The function first obtains a pointer to the WiFi object managed by the CcspBEManager.\n   - It then retrieves the GAS configuration (pGASconf) associated with the WiFi object.\n   - The GAS configuration is copied into the provided `curr_cfg` structure.\n   - The function prints a trace message indicating that the initial GAS configuration has been fetched.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n   - The function interacts with the CcspBEManager component to obtain the WiFi object and the GAS configuration.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n   - **Parameters:**\n     - `curr_cfg`: Pointer to a `wifi_config_t` structure that will receive the initial GAS configuration.\n   - **Return values:**\n     - `RETURN_OK` if the initial GAS configuration was successfully retrieved, or an error code otherwise.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n   - The function is a part of the RDK CcspWifiAgent component, which is responsible for managing WiFi functionality in RDK devices.\n   - The GAS configuration is used for devices that support GAS advertisement and response.",
