  "response": "**1. Purpose of this structure:**\n\nThe `moca_cfg_t` structure contains configuration parameters for a MoCA (Multimedia over Coax) interface. It allows the system to configure and control the behavior of the MoCA interface, such as enabling or disabling it, setting privacy options, and adjusting power settings.\n\n**2. Key fields and their significance:**\n\n- `InstanceNumber`: The instance number of the MoCA interface. This field is used only when multiple MoCA interfaces exist on the system.\n- `Alias`: The alias name for the MoCA interface.\n- `bEnabled`: A flag indicating whether the MoCA interface is enabled or disabled.\n- `bPreferredNC`: A flag indicating whether the node prefers to be the network coordinator.\n- `PrivacyEnabledSetting`: A flag indicating whether link privacy is enabled.\n- `FreqCurrentMaskSetting`: A bitmask specifying the set of frequencies that should be used for forming a network.\n- `KeyPassphrase`: The privacy password for the MoCA link.\n- `TxPowerLimit`: The maximum transmission power allowed for the MoCA interface.\n- `AutoPowerControlPhyRate`: The target PHY rate used for adjusting power.\n- `BeaconPowerLimit`: The maximum transmission power allowed when transmitting beacons.\n- `Reset`: A flag indicating whether to reset the MoCA configuration parameters to defaults.\n- `MixedMode`: A flag indicating whether the node should operate in mixed mode, supporting different MoCA protocol versions.\n- `ChannelScanning`: A flag indicating whether the node should operate in single frequency mode or scanning mode.\n- `AutoPowerControlEnable`: A flag indicating whether to enable auto-power control for adjusting power.\n- `EnableTabooBit`: A flag indicating whether to enable support for the taboo mask.\n- `NodeTabooMask`: A bitmask specifying the set of frequencies that should be avoided.\n- `ChannelScanMask`: A bitmask specifying the set of frequencies to scan for beacons to form a network.\n\n**3. Usage context in RDK:**\n\nThe `moca_cfg_t` structure is used by the RDK HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) to configure and control MoCA interfaces on the system. It is typically used in conjunction with other HAL structures and APIs to manage MoCA network connections and data transfer.\n\n**4. Related components or interfaces:**\n\n- `hal`: The RDK HAL component provides a set of APIs and structures for interfacing with hardware devices, including MoCA interfaces.\n- `moca`: The RDK MoCA component provides additional functionality for managing MoCA networks and data transfer.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related details:**\n\nThe `moca_cfg_t` structure is defined in the `rdk_hal_moca_cfg.h` header file and is part of the RDK HAL. It is used by various RDK applications and components to configure and manage MoCA interfaces.",
