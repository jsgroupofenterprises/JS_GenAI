It retrieves the registered callback handler from a tree data structure based on the request ID, calls the callback with the response data, and removes the handler from the tree.\n\n### Key Operations and Data Flow\n1. The function first retrieves the registered callback handler from a tree using the request ID.\n2. It checks if the response is empty (for \"op\":\"comment\" requests) and removes the empty response if found.\n3. The function then calls the registered callback with the request ID, error status, response data, and callback-specific data.\n4. Finally, it removes the callback handler from the tree and frees the memory allocated for it.\n\n### Interaction with Other Components\nThe ovsdb_rpc_callback function interacts with the following components:\n- OVSDB agent: It receives JSON-RPC requests from the OVSDB agent.\n- Callback handlers: It calls registered callback handlers to process the responses.\n\n### Important Parameters and Return Values\n- **id**: The ID of the JSON-RPC request.\n- **is_error**: Boolean indicating whether the response contains an error.\n- **jsmsg**: JSON response data.\n- **rh->rrh_callback**: The registered callback function.\n- **rh->data**: Callback-specific data.\n\nThe function returns a boolean indicating the success of the callback processing.\n\n### RDK-Related Operations\nThe ovsdb_rpc_callback function is part of the RDK CcspWifiAgent component, which handles Wi-Fi-related operations. It is used for communication between the OVSDB agent and the CcspWifiAgent to exchange JSON-RPC requests and responses.",
