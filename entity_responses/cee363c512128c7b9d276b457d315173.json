  "response": "## Main purpose and functionality\n\nThe `wifi_getMultiPskKeys` function is used to retrieve the multi-PSK keys for a given access point. Multi-PSK is a security feature that allows multiple pre-shared keys (PSKs) to be used to secure a wireless network. This can be useful in environments where multiple devices need to connect to the same network but have different levels of security.\n\n## Key operations and data flow\n\nThe `wifi_getMultiPskKeys` function takes the following parameters:\n\n* `apIndex`: The index of the access point.\n* `keys`: A pointer to a buffer where the multi-PSK keys will be stored.\n* `keysNumber`: The number of multi-PSK keys to retrieve.\n\nThe function will retrieve the multi-PSK keys for the specified access point and store them in the provided buffer. The keys will be stored in an array of `wifi_key_multi_psk_t` structures.\n\n## Interaction with other components\n\nThe `wifi_getMultiPskKeys` function interacts with the following components:\n\n* The Wi-Fi driver: The function uses the Wi-Fi driver to retrieve the multi-PSK keys from the access point.\n\n## Important parameters and return values\n\nThe following parameters are important to note:\n\n* `keys`: The buffer where the multi-PSK keys will be stored. This buffer must be large enough to hold the keys.\n* `keysNumber`: The number of multi-PSK keys to retrieve. This value must be greater than 0.\n\nThe function returns the following values:\n\n* `RETURN_OK`: The function was successful.\n* `RETURN_ERR`: The function failed.\n\n## Any specific RDK-related operations\n\nThe `wifi_getMultiPskKeys` function is not specific to RDK. It can be used in any application that needs to retrieve the multi-PSK keys for a wireless network.",
