  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**:\n   - The `ActiveMeasurement_Step_GetEntry` function is a part of the CcspWifiAgent component and is used to retrieve an entry from the Active Measurement Step table.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n   - The function takes three parameters:\n     - `hInsContext`: The instance context of the caller.\n     - `nIndex`: The index of the entry to retrieve.\n     - `pInsNumber`: A pointer to a variable that will receive the instance number of the entry.\n   - The function validates the `nIndex` parameter to ensure that it is within the range of valid indices for the Active Measurement Step table.\n   - It then retrieves the pointer to the Active Measurement Step table and the instance number of the entry.\n   - Finally, it returns the pointer to the entry.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**:\n   - The function interacts with the following components:\n     - CcspWifiAgent: The main component that manages the Wi-Fi subsystem.\n     - COSA_DATAMODEL_WIFI: The data model for the Wi-Fi subsystem.\n     - COSA_DML_WIFI_HARVESTER: The data model for the Active Measurement Harvester.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n   - `hInsContext`: The instance context of the caller.\n   - `nIndex`: The index of the entry to retrieve.\n   - `pInsNumber`: A pointer to a variable that will receive the instance number of the entry.\n   - The function returns a pointer to the entry if successful, or NULL if the index is out of range.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**:\n   - None.",
