  "response": "## qm_conn_send_req Function Analysis\n\n### 1. Main Purpose and Functionality\n\nThe `qm_conn_send_req()` function in the CcspWifiAgent component of the RDK is responsible for sending a request to a specified topic via a QMAP connection. It encapsulates the QMAP request within an RDK connection and sends it to the specified topic. It handles the opening and closing of the connection, as well as the actual send operation.\n\n### 2. Key Operations and Data Flow\n\n- The function takes a `qm_request_t` structure, a topic name, data to be sent, the data size, and a `qm_response_t` structure as input.\n- It first opens a QMAP connection using `qm_conn_open_fd()`.\n- If the connection is successful, it sends the request with the data using `qm_conn_send_fd()`.\n- After sending the request, it closes the QMAP connection using `close()`.\n- The function returns `true` if the request was successfully sent, otherwise it returns `false`.\n\n### 3. Interaction with Other Components\n\n- The function interacts with the QMAP library to send the request and receive the response.\n\n### 4. Important Parameters and Return Values\n\n- `req`: Pointer to a `qm_request_t` structure containing the request details.\n- `topic`: Name of the topic to which the request will be sent.\n- `data`: Pointer to the data to be sent.\n- `data_size`: Size of the data in bytes.\n- `res`: Pointer to a `qm_response_t` structure to store the response.\n- Return value: Boolean indicating success (`true`) or failure (`false`).\n\n### 5. RDK-Related Operations\n\n- The function uses the RDK's `qm_conn_open_fd()` and `qm_conn_send_fd()` functions to handle the QMAP connection. These functions are part of the CcspWifiAgent component specifically designed for managing QMAP connections within the RDK framework.",
