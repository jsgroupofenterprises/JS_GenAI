  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n* The csiDataHandler function is an event handler for the \"Device.WiFi.X_RDK_CSI.%d.data\" event.\n* When this event is received, the function parses the event data and extracts the CSI data from the event.\n* The CSI data is then stored in a file named \"/tmp/CSI.bin\".\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n* The main operations performed by the csiDataHandler function are:\n    * Parse the event data to extract the CSI data.\n    * Store the CSI data in a file named \"/tmp/CSI.bin\".\n* The data flow is as follows:\n    * The event data is received as input to the function.\n    * The event data is parsed to extract the CSI data.\n    * The CSI data is stored in a file named \"/tmp/CSI.bin\".\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n* The csiDataHandler function interacts with the following components:\n    * The RDK event bus\n    * The RDK file system\n* The csiDataHandler function subscribes to the \"Device.WiFi.X_RDK_CSI.%d.data\" event on the RDK event bus.\n* When this event is received, the function reads the CSI data from the event and stores it in a file named \"/tmp/CSI.bin\".\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n* The important parameters of the csiDataHandler function are:\n    * handle: A handle to the RDK event bus.\n    * event: A pointer to the event data.\n    * subscription: A pointer to the event subscription.\n* The csiDataHandler function does not return a value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n* The csiDataHandler function uses the following RDK-related operations:\n    * rbusEvent_Subscribe: Subscribes to the \"Device.WiFi.X_RDK_CSI.%d.data\" event on the RDK event bus.\n    * rbusValue_GetBytes: Reads the CSI data from the event.\n    * rbusObject_GetValue: Reads the CSI data from the event.",
