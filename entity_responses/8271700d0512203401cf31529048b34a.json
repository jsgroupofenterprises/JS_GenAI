  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n   \n  - This function validates the active measurements parameters set by the user.\n  - It checks if the provided values for `packet size`, `number of samples` and `sample duration` are within the allowed range.\n  - If any of the parameters are invalid, it returns `FALSE` along with the parameter name that failed validation. Otherwise, it returns `TRUE`. \n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n  - The function first checks if the `active measurement packet size` has changed.\n    - If it has changed, it verifies that the new value is within the allowed range (`MIN_ACTIVE_MSMT_PKT_SIZE` to `MAX_ACTIVE_MSMT_PKT_SIZE`).\n    - If the value is invalid, it sets the `pReturnParamName` to `\"PacketSize\"` and returns `FALSE`.\n\n  - The function then checks if the `active measurement number of samples` has changed.\n    - If it has changed, it verifies that the new value is within the allowed range (`MIN_ACTIVE_MSMT_SAMPLE_COUNT` to `MAX_ACTIVE_MSMT_SAMPLE_COUNT`).\n    - If the value is invalid, it sets the `pReturnParamName` to `\"NumberOfSamples\"` and returns `FALSE`.\n\n  - Finally, the function checks if the `active measurement sample duration` has changed.\n    - If it has changed, it verifies that the new value is within the allowed range (`MIN_ACTIVE_MSMT_SAMPLE_DURATION` to `MAX_ACTIVE_MSMT_SAMPLE_DURATION`).\n    - If the value is invalid, it sets the `pReturnParamName` to `\"SampleDuration\"` and returns `FALSE`.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\n  - This function interacts with the following components:\n    - `PCOSA_DATAMODEL_WIFI (pMyObject)`: This is the data model for the Wi-Fi interface.\n    - `PCOSA_DML_WIFI_HARVESTER (pHarvester)`: This is the harvester object for the Wi-Fi interface.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n  - **Parameters**:\n    - `hInsContext`: The instance context handle. (UNUSED)\n    - `pReturnParamName`: A pointer to a buffer that will receive the name of the parameter that failed validation.\n    - `puLength`: A pointer to a variable that will receive the length of the `pReturnParamName` buffer.\n\n  - **Return values**:\n    - `TRUE` if all parameters are valid.\n    - `FALSE` if any parameter is invalid.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\n  - This function is part of the RDK Wi-Fi Agent component.\n  - It is used to validate the active measurements parameters set by the user.",
