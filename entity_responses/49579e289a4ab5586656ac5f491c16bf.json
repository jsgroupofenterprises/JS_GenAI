  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**: \n\n   - The main purpose of the `pjs_int_q_from_json` function is to read an integer value from a JSON object using a specified name. \n   - This function can also optionally check if the integer exists in the JSON object before reading its value.\n\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**: \n\n   - The function first validates its input parameters.\n   - It then calls the `pjs_basic_q_from_json` function to perform the actual JSON parsing and value extraction.\n   - The `pjs_basic_q_from_json` function uses a specific type conversion function (in this case, `pjs_int_t_from_json`) to convert the JSON value to the desired integer type.\n   - The extracted value is then stored in the output pointer `out`, and the existence flag `exists` is set accordingly.\n\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**: \n\n   - This function does not directly interact with other components. However, it relies on the `pjs_basic_q_from_json` function for the JSON parsing and value extraction.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**: \n\n   - **input parameters**: \n     - `out`: Pointer to an integer variable to store the extracted value.\n     - `exists`: Pointer to a boolean variable to indicate if the integer exists in the JSON object.\n     - `js`: Pointer to the JSON object to be parsed.\n     - `name`: Name of the JSON property to be extracted.\n     - `update`: Boolean value indicating if the JSON object should be updated with the extracted value.\n     - `err`: Error message structure to report any errors encountered during the operation.\n   - **return value**: \n     - Returns `true` if the integer was successfully extracted or did not exist, and `false` otherwise.\n\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**: \n\n   - This function does not perform any RDK-specific operations.",
