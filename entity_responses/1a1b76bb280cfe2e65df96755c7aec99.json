  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\n  - This function allows the caller to register a callback function that will be invoked when an EAP failure occurs during a RADIUS authentication process for a Wi-Fi connection.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n  - The function takes a single parameter, 'callback_proc', which is a pointer to the callback function that will be invoked when an EAP failure occurs.\n  - When an EAP failure occurs, the callback function will be invoked with the following parameters:\n    - The Wi-Fi interface index where the EAP failure occurred\n    - The EAP type that failed\n    - The EAP failure reason\n  - The callback function can then take appropriate action, such as displaying an error message to the user or retrying the authentication process.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\n  - This function interacts with the Wi-Fi driver to register the callback function and with the RADIUS server to receive EAP failure notifications.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n  - **'callback_proc':** Pointer to the callback function that will be invoked when an EAP failure occurs.\n  - **Return value:** None.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\n  - This function is part of the RDK Wi-Fi HAL API, which provides a set of common functions for Wi-Fi device drivers and applications.",
