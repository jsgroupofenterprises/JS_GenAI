  "response": "**Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe wifi_dpp APIs provide a way for a DPP Authenticator device to interact with a DPP Enrollee Device.\nThe DPP Authenticator device is typically a wifi access point, while the DPP Enrollee Device is\na network client device, like a smart phone. A DPP Authenticator can read the Enrollee device's\nDPP URI, which is typically obtained from a QR code displayed on the screen of the Enrollee device.\n\n**Key operations and data flow:**\n\nThe wifi_dpp APIs support the following key operations:\n\n* Generating and storing DPP credentials on the authenticator.\n* Reading the DPP URI from the enrollee.\n* Authenticating the enrollee to the authenticator using the credentials.\n\nThe data flow for a typical DPP authentication is as follows:\n\n1. The authenticator generates and stores DPP credentials.\n2. The enrollee reads the DPP URI from the authenticator.\n3. The enrollee uses the DPP URI to create a DPP configuration.\n4. The enrollee connects to the authenticator using the DPP configuration.\n5. The authenticator authenticates the enrollee using the DPP credentials.\n\n**Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThe wifi_dpp APIs interact with the following other components:\n\n* The wifi HAL\n* The DPP library\n\n**Important parameters and return values:**\n\nThe following are the most important parameters and return values for the wifi_dpp APIs:\n\n* **wifi_dpp_generate_credentials()**: This function generates and stores DPP credentials on the authenticator. The function takes the following parameters:\n    * **apIndex**: The index of the authenticator.\n    * **output_ssid**: A pointer to a buffer where the SSID of the authenticator will be stored.\n    * **output_passphrase**: A pointer to a buffer where the passphrase of the authenticator will be stored.\n* **wifi_dpp_read_uri()**: This function reads the DPP URI from the enrollee. The function takes the following parameters:\n    * **apIndex**: The index of the authenticator.\n    * **input_uri**: A pointer to a buffer containing the DPP URI.\n* **wifi_dpp_authenticate()**: This function authenticates the enrollee to the authenticator using the credentials. The function takes the following parameters:\n    * **apIndex**: The index of the authenticator.\n    * **mac**: The MAC address of the enrollee.\n\n**Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThe wifi_dpp APIs are not specific to RDK. However, the APIs can be used to implement DPP authentication in RDK-based devices.",
