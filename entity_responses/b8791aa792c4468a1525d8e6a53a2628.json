  "response": "## Structure Analysis: _HALCOSA_DML_ETH_PORT_DINFO\n\n### 1. Purpose\nThis structure, defined within the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) component, is used to provide diagnostic information about an Ethernet port. It contains data on the port's status, current bit rate, time of last status change, and the number of devices associated with it.\n\n### 2. Key Fields\n- **Status**: Port's current status (e.g., active, inactive, link up/down).\n- **CurrentBitRate**: Current bit rate of the port in bits per second.\n- **LastChange**: Timestamp indicating the time of the last status change for the port.\n- **AssocDevicesCount**: Number of devices currently associated with the port.\n\n### 3. Usage Context in RDK\nThis structure is typically used in RDK-based systems to:\n- Monitor the status and performance of Ethernet ports.\n- Identify and troubleshoot connectivity issues.\n- Gather information for network management and diagnostics.\n\n### 4. Related Components or Interfaces\n- **_HALCOSA_DML_ETH_PORT_DINFO_GET**: API function that retrieves the diagnostic information for an Ethernet port.\n- **Network management interfaces**: Used to access the data stored in this structure for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.\n\n### 5. Specific RDK-Related Details\n- This structure is part of the RDK Diagnostics Management Layer (DML) API.\n- It is defined in the `halcosa_dml_eth_port.h` header file.\n- It is primarily used by the RDK Network Diagnostics Framework (NDF) for port diagnostics and troubleshooting.",
