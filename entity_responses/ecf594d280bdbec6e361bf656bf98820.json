  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - The `greylist_cache_timeout` function is responsible for managing the greylisting feature in the RDK WifiAgent.\n   - It reads a list of MAC addresses from a file, adds them to the greylist, and starts a timer for each MAC address.\n   - When the timer expires, the MAC address is removed from the greylist.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow:**\n   - The function opens the \"/nvram/greylist_mac.txt\" file and reads the list of MAC addresses.\n   - For each MAC address, it creates a `greylist_mac` structure and adds it to the greylist.\n   - It then calculates the time left until the timer for the MAC address expires and starts a timer for the remaining time.\n   - When the timer expires, the MAC address is removed from the greylist.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any):**\n   - The function interacts with the following components:\n     - The hostapd daemon, which is used to add and remove MAC addresses from the greylist.\n     - The eloop event loop, which is used to start and cancel timers.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values:**\n   - The function takes the following parameters:\n     - `hapd`: A pointer to the hostapd data structure.\n   - The function does not return any value.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n   - The function uses the following RDK-specific operations:\n     - The `wifi_add_mac_handler` function, which is used to add a MAC address to the greylist.\n     - The `wifi_del_mac_handler` function, which is used to remove a MAC address from the greylist.",
