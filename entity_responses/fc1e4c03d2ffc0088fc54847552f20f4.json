  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `tcp_server_listen` function sets up a TCP server socket for listening to incoming client connections. It makes the socket non-blocking, sets the close-on-exec flag, and calls the `listen` system call to start listening for connections.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n- The function takes a socket file descriptor as input.\n- It sets the socket to non-blocking mode using the `fcntl` system call. This allows the server to handle multiple connections concurrently without blocking.\n- It sets the close-on-exec flag using the `fcntl` system call. This ensures that the socket is closed when the server process exits.\n- It calls the `listen` system call to start listening for connections on the socket. The `listen` function takes two arguments: the socket file descriptor and the maximum number of connections that can be queued.\n- The function returns a status code indicating success or failure.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\n- This function is typically called from the main function of a server program. It initializes the server socket and prepares it for listening to client connections. Once the server is listening, it can use the `accept` system call to accept incoming connections and create new sockets for communication with each client.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n- `sock_fd`: The file descriptor of the socket to listen on.\n- `status`: The status code indicating success or failure. A value of 0 indicates success, and a negative value indicates failure.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\n- This function does not perform any RDK-specific operations.",
