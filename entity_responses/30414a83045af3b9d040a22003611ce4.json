  "response": "## Main purpose and functionality\n\nThe `voice_hal_getOutboundProxy` function is part of the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) component of the RDK Voice module. Its purpose is to retrieve the outbound proxy address (IP address or domain name) that is used by the voice service to send SIP messages outside of the local network.\n\n## Key operations and data flow\n\nThe function takes the following parameters:\n\n* `service`: the voice service for which the outbound proxy address is to be retrieved\n* `profile`: the voice profile for which the outbound proxy address is to be retrieved\n* `ipNameAddress`: a pointer to a character buffer where the outbound proxy address will be stored\n* `pLength`: a pointer to an integer that specifies the length of the character buffer\n\nThe function first checks if the outbound proxy address has been set for the specified voice service and profile. If it has, the function copies the outbound proxy address into the character buffer provided by the caller.\n\nIf the outbound proxy address has not been set, the function returns an error code.\n\n## Interaction with other components\n\nThe `voice_hal_getOutboundProxy` function interacts with the following other components:\n\n* The Voice Service Manager (VSM): the VSM is responsible for managing voice services and profiles. The `voice_hal_getOutboundProxy` function gets the outbound proxy address from the VSM.\n* The SIP User Agent (UA): the SIP UA is responsible for sending and receiving SIP messages. The `voice_hal_getOutboundProxy` function provides the outbound proxy address to the SIP UA.\n\n## Important parameters and return values\n\nThe following parameters and return values are important to note:\n\n* `service`: the voice service for which the outbound proxy address is to be retrieved\n* `profile`: the voice profile for which the outbound proxy address is to be retrieved\n* `ipNameAddress`: a pointer to a character buffer where the outbound proxy address will be stored\n* `pLength`: a pointer to an integer that specifies the length of the character buffer\n* `RDK_SUCCESS`: the function was successful\n* `RDK_FAILURE`: the function failed\n\n## Any specific RDK-related operations\n\nThe `voice_hal_getOutboundProxy` function is a specific RDK-related operation because it is part of the RDK Voice module. The function is used to retrieve the outbound proxy address for a voice service and profile, which is used by the SIP UA to send SIP messages outside of the local network.",
