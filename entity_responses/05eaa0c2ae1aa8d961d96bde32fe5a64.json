  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe DPP (Wi-Fi Device Provisioning Protocol) allows devices to be securely provisioned and authenticated using the Wi-Fi network.\nThe protocol is based on the use of public key cryptography and the exchange of certificates.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe DPP protocol involves the following key operations:\n\n* **Key generation:** Each device generates a public/private key pair.\n* **Certificate generation:** Each device generates a certificate that contains its public key and is signed by its private key.\n* **Certificate exchange:** The devices exchange their certificates.\n* **Key derivation:** The devices use the exchanged certificates to derive a shared secret key.\n* **Authentication:** The devices use the shared secret key to authenticate each other.\n\nThe data flow of the DPP protocol is as follows:\n\n1. The provisioner (e.g., a smartphone) sends a DPP request to the enrollee (e.g., a Wi-Fi device).\n2. The enrollee responds with its certificate.\n3. The provisioner verifies the enrollee's certificate and sends its own certificate.\n4. The devices derive a shared secret key using the exchanged certificates.\n5. The devices authenticate each other using the shared secret key.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe DPP protocol does not require any interaction with other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following are important parameters and return values of the DPP protocol:\n\n* **DPP request:** The DPP request message contains the following parameters:\n    * The provisioner's public key\n    * The provisioner's certificate\n    * The enrollee's MAC address\n* **DPP response:** The DPP response message contains the following parameters:\n    * The enrollee's public key\n    * The enrollee's certificate\n    * The shared secret key\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe DPP protocol is not specific to RDK. However, there are some specific RDK-related operations that can be used with DPP.\n\nFor example, the RDK provides a DPP library that can be used to implement the DPP protocol on RDK devices. The library provides a set of functions that can be used to generate keys, certificates, and shared secret keys.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n* **wifi_dppInitiatorStart:** Starts the DPP process and sends a DPP request message .\n* **wifi_dppInitiatorComplete:** Completes the DPP process and generates a shared secret key using request and response data.\n* **wifi_dppEnrolleeStart:** Starts the DPP process for an enrollee device and listens for DPP request message.\n* **wifi_dppEnrolleeResponse:** Generates and sends a DPP response \n* **wifi_dppSetConfig:** Sets configuration related to DPP .\n* **wifi_dppGetConfig:** Gets configuration related to DPP .\n* **wifi_dppRemoveSession:** Removes a DPP session \n* **wifi_dppGetPeerCert:** Retrieves the peer's certificate by using a peer's MAC address.\n* **wifi_dppGetPeerKey:** Retrieves the peer's key by using a peer's MAC address.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* DPP is a secure protocol that can be used to provision and authenticate devices over a Wi-Fi network.\n* DPP is based on the use of public key cryptography and the exchange of certificates.\n* DPP does not require any interaction with other components.\n* The RDK provides a DPP library that can be used to implement the DPP protocol on RDK devices.",
