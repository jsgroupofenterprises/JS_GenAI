  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `auth_frame_received` function is a callback function that is registered to receive authentication frames from a wireless client station (STA). When an authentication frame is received, the function is called with the following parameters:\n\n* `ap_index`: The index of the access point (AP) that received the frame.\n* `sta`: The MAC address of the STA that sent the frame.\n* `data`: A pointer to the data in the frame.\n* `len`: The length of the data in the frame.\n\nThe function processes the authentication frame and takes appropriate action, such as sending an authentication response frame or associating the STA with the AP.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe `auth_frame_received` function first checks the type of authentication frame that was received. If the frame is an authentication request frame, the function sends an authentication response frame to the STA. If the frame is an authentication response frame, the function checks the status of the authentication attempt. If the authentication attempt was successful, the function associates the STA with the AP.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `auth_frame_received` function interacts with the following components:\n\n* The wireless driver: The wireless driver provides the function with the authentication frames that are received from STAs.\n* The AP: The AP provides the function with the information that is needed to process the authentication frames, such as the SSID and security settings.\n* The STA: The STA sends authentication frames to the AP.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following parameters and return values are important:\n\n* `ap_index`: The index of the AP that received the frame. This parameter is used to identify the AP that is responsible for processing the frame.\n* `sta`: The MAC address of the STA that sent the frame. This parameter is used to identify the STA that is attempting to authenticate with the AP.\n* `data`: A pointer to the data in the frame. This parameter contains the authentication information that is sent from the STA to the AP.\n* `len`: The length of the data in the frame. This parameter specifies the amount of data that is contained in the frame.\n\nThe `auth_frame_received` function does not return a value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `auth_frame_received` function is part of the RDK Wi-Fi Agent, which is a component of the RDK software platform. The Wi-Fi Agent provides a set of APIs that can be used to manage Wi-Fi networks and devices.",
