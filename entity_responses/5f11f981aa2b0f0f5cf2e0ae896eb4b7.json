  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `hapd_reload_authentication` function in `CcspWifiAgent` updates the authentication credentials for a specific access point (AP). It allows changing the WPA passphrase for the AP, which is used for client authentication.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n- The function takes two parameters: `apIndex`, which specifies the index of the AP to modify, and `keyPassphrase`, which is the new WPA passphrase.\n- It first checks if the AP is active and started. If not, it returns an error (-1).\n- If the AP is active, the function updates the WPA passphrase in the AP's configuration.\n- It clears any existing WPA passphrase and sets the new one.\n- It then sets up the WPA Pre-Shared Key (PSK) based on the new passphrase.\n- If necessary, it reconfigures the AP's WPA settings and updates the kernel driver with the new WPA IE (if applicable).\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\n- The function interacts with the hostapd daemon, which manages the AP.\n- It updates the AP's configuration using hostapd's API functions.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n- `apIndex`: Index of the AP to modify.\n- `keyPassphrase`: The new WPA passphrase.\n- Return value: 0 on success, -1 on error.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\n- The function does not perform any RDK-specific operations.",
