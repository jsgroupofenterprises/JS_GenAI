  "response": "### 1. Main purpose and functionality\n\nThe wifi_getBandSteeringRSSIThreshold function is used to get the band steering RSSI threshold. The band steering RSSI threshold is the minimum RSSI value that a client must have in order to be steered to the 5GHz band.\n\n### 2. Key operations and data flow\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n* radioIndex: The index of the radio interface for which the band steering RSSI threshold is being retrieved.\n* pRssiThreshold: A pointer to a variable in which the band steering RSSI threshold will be returned.\n\nThe function first checks if the radioIndex is valid. If the radioIndex is invalid, the function returns RETURN_ERR.\n\nIf the radioIndex is valid, the function gets the band steering RSSI threshold from the driver. The band steering RSSI threshold is stored in the pRssiThreshold variable.\n\nThe function then returns RETURN_OK.\n\n### 3. Interaction with other components (if any)\n\nThe wifi_getBandSteeringRSSIThreshold function interacts with the driver to get the band steering RSSI threshold.\n\n### 4. Important parameters and return values\n\nThe following parameters are important:\n\n* **radioIndex**: The index of the radio interface for which the band steering RSSI threshold is being retrieved.\n* **pRssiThreshold**: A pointer to a variable in which the band steering RSSI threshold will be returned.\n\nThe function returns the following values:\n\n* **RETURN_OK**: The function was successful.\n* **RETURN_ERR**: The function failed.\n\n### 5. Any specific RDK-related operations\n\nThe wifi_getBandSteeringRSSIThreshold function is not specific to RDK.",
