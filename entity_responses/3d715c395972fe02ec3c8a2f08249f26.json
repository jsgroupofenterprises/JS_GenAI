  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\nThe `INT` function defines the data type of the callback function `wifi_newApAssociatedDevice_callback`. The callback function is called when a new device gets associated with the access point.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\nThe callback function takes two parameters:\n- `apIndex`: Index of the access point.\n- `associated_dev`: Pointer to the associated device structure.\n\nThe callback function can be registered using the `wifi_newApAssociatedDevice_callback_register` function.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\nThe callback function is called by the Wi-Fi driver when a new device gets associated with the access point. The callback function can then interact with other components, such as the network manager, to handle the new device.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\nThe important parameters of the callback function are:\n- `apIndex`: Index of the access point.\n- `associated_dev`: Pointer to the associated device structure.\n\nThe callback function returns an `INT` value, which indicates the status of the operation. The following values are possible:\n- `RETURN_OK` if successful.\n- `RETURN_ERR` if any error is detected.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\nThe `INT` function is part of the RDK Wi-Fi HAL. The RDK Wi-Fi HAL provides a set of APIs for developers to interact with the Wi-Fi driver.",
