  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `ovsdb_cache_dump_table` function in the CcspWifiAgent component is responsible for printing out the contents of an Open vSwitch Database (OVSDB) cache table. It iterates through the rows in the table and prints out the UUID, version, and key (if applicable) for each row.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n* `table`: A pointer to the OVSDB cache table that we want to print out.\n* `str`: A string that is appended to the end of the output.\n\nThe function first checks if the log severity is set to DEBUG or higher. If it is not, the function returns early.\n\nIf the log severity is set to DEBUG or higher, the function prints out the name of the table and the value of the `str` parameter.\n\nThe function then iterates through the rows in the table using the `ds_tree_foreach` macro. For each row, the function prints out the UUID, version, and key (if applicable) for the row.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThis function is not known to interact with any other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\nThe `table` parameter is a pointer to the OVSDB cache table that we want to print out.\n\nThe `str` parameter is a string that is appended to the end of the output.\n\nThe function does not return any value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThis function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
