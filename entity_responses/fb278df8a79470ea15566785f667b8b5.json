  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `voice_hal_setCCTKTraceGroup` function in the RDK Voice HAL library is used to enable or disable the trace groups for CCTK (CableCard Trust Key) logging. CCTK logs provide information related to the CableCard and its secure interactions with the host device.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n* `service`: Specifies the voice service for which the trace group is being set.\n* `bitmask`: A string representing a bitmask that specifies which trace groups to enable or disable. Each bit in the bitmask corresponds to a specific trace group.\n\nThe function sets the trace group bitmask for the specified voice service. This allows the user to selectively enable or disable logging for different trace groups.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThis function interacts with the underlying CCTK logging subsystem to enable or disable the specified trace groups.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* **Parameters:**\n    * `service`: The voice service for which the trace group is being set.\n    * `bitmask`: The bitmask specifying which trace groups to enable or disable.\n* **Return value:**\n    * The function returns `RDK_SUCCESS` on success or `RDK_FAILURE` on failure.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThis function is part of the RDK Voice HAL library, which provides a standardized interface for interacting with voice-related functionality in RDK-based devices.",
