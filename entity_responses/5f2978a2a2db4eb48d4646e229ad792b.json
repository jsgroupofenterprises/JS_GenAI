  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**: The `wifi_getCountryIe` function is used to retrieve the country information element (IE) for a given access point (AP) index. The country IE is a regulatory domain-specific parameter that indicates the country in which the AP is operating. This information is used by the driver to configure the AP's transmit power and other settings to comply with local regulations.\n\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**: The function takes two parameters:\n\n   - `apIndex`: The index of the AP for which the country IE is to be retrieved.\n   - `enabled`: A pointer to a boolean variable that will be set to `TRUE` if the country IE is enabled, or `FALSE` if it is disabled.\n\n   The function retrieves the country IE from the driver and sets the `enabled` variable accordingly.\n\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**: The `wifi_getCountryIe` function interacts with the driver to retrieve the country IE.\n\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n\n   - `apIndex`: The index of the AP for which the country IE is to be retrieved.\n   - `enabled`: A pointer to a boolean variable that will be set to `TRUE` if the country IE is enabled, or `FALSE` if it is disabled.\n   - `INT`: The function returns a status code indicating the success or failure of the operation.\n\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**: The `wifi_getCountryIe` function is not specific to RDK. It is a generic function that can be used in any Wi-Fi system.",
