  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\nThe `mon_install_parent_signals` function is responsible for installing signal handlers for the parent process in the OneWifi component. These signal handlers allow the parent process to handle signals (such as SIGTERM and SIGINT) and take appropriate actions, such as forwarding them to the child process or resetting the parent's signal handling.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\nThe function begins by declaring several static variables, including:\n- `mon_counter_list`: A pointer to a shared memory segment where the monitor counter list will be initialized.\n- `mon_sig_forward_pid`: The PID of the child process to which SIGTERM and SIGINT will be forwarded.\n\nThe function then installs signal handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT using the `signal()` function. These signal handlers call the `mon_sig_forward()` function to forward the signals to the child process.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\nThe `mon_install_parent_signals` function interacts with the following other components:\n- The child process, which is created by the `fork()` function in the `mon_start()` function.\n- The `mon_sig_forward()` function, which is called by the signal handlers to forward signals to the child process.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\nThe function does not have any parameters and does not return any value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\nThe function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
