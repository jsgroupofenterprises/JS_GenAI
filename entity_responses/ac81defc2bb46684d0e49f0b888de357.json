  "response": "## Analysis of _HALCOSA_DML_DHCPS_SADDR Structure\n\n### Purpose\n\nThis structure is used to represent a static DHCP server address lease in the RDK (Reference Design Kit) software framework.\n\n### Key Fields and Significance\n\n* **InstanceNumber:** Unique instance number of the DHCP server lease.\n* **Alias:** User-defined alias name for the lease.\n* **bEnabled:** True if the lease is enabled, false if disabled.\n* **Chaddr:** MAC address of the client device associated with the lease.\n* **Yiaddr:** IP address assigned to the client device by the DHCP server.\n* **DeviceName:** Name of the client device associated with the lease.\n* **Comment:** Optional comment field for additional lease information.\n* **ActiveFlag:** True if the lease is active, false if it is inactive.\n\n### Usage Context in RDK\n\nThis structure is used in the following contexts:\n\n* Configuring static DHCP server leases in the RDK.\n* Maintaining information about active DHCP server leases.\n* Troubleshooting DHCP server lease issues.\n\n### Related Components or Interfaces\n\n* HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) component\n* DML (Data Model Library) component\n* DHCPS (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Server) interface\n\n### RDK-Related Details\n\nThis structure is part of the RDK's CosaData (CableLabs Open Source Data Models) framework. It is specifically designed for use with the DHCPS interface, which provides the RDK with a set of APIs for managing DHCP server leases.",
