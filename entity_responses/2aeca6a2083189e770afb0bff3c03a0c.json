  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `init_web_config` function initializes the web configuration for the wireless radio. It registers the necessary subdocuments with the framework and sets the version information.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function starts by defining an array of subdocument names. Then, it allocates memory for the blob data structure and initializes it with the subdocument names.\n\nNext, it sets up the version get and set functions for the WiFi blob. These functions are used to get and set the version of the WiFi blob.\n\nFinally, it registers the subdocuments with the framework and registers the multi-component subdocuments.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe function interacts with the following components:\n\n* Framework: The function registers the subdocuments with the framework.\n* WiFi agent: The function gets and sets the version of the WiFi blob.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe function takes no parameters and returns an integer indicating the status of the operation. A value of `RETURN_OK` indicates that the operation was successful. A value of `RETURN_ERR` indicates that the operation failed.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe function uses the following RDK-related operations:\n\n* `register_sub_docs`: Registers the subdocuments with the framework.\n* `register_multicomp_subdocs`: Registers the multi-component subdocuments with the framework.",
