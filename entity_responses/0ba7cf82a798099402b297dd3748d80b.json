  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `CosaSListPushEntryByInsNum` function adds a `CosaContext` object to a linked list based on its instance number. The linked list is sorted in ascending order of instance numbers. This function is used to maintain a sorted list of `CosaContext` objects within the Cable Cable Service Provider Device (CCSP) Wifi Agent.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\na. The function first checks if the linked list is empty. If it is, the `CosaContext` object is added to the end of the list.\nb. If the linked list is not empty, the function iterates through the list until it finds the correct position to insert the `CosaContext` object. The correct position is determined by comparing the instance number of the new `CosaContext` object with the instance numbers of the existing objects in the list.\nc. Once the correct position is found, the `CosaContext` object is inserted into the list at that position.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components:**\n\nThis function is used internally by the CCSP Wifi Agent to maintain its list of `CosaContext` objects. It does not directly interact with any other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n* `pListHead`: A pointer to the head of the linked list.\n* `pCosaContext`: A pointer to the `CosaContext` object to be added to the list.\n* `ANSC_STATUS`: A status code indicating the success or failure of the operation.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThis function uses the `AnscSList` API, which is part of the RDK agent software. The `AnscSList` API provides a set of functions for manipulating linked lists.",
