  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**: The `os_nif_netmask_set` function sets the netmask address of the specified network interface (`ifname`). It's part of the CcspWifiAgent component for RDK, handling network configuration.\n\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n   - The function takes two parameters: `ifname` (the interface name) and `addr` (the netmask address to set).\n   - It uses the `os_nif_ifreq` function to send an `SIOCSIFNETMASK` request to the kernel, passing the interface name and a structure containing the new netmask address.\n   - The `os_nif_ifreq` function performs the actual system call to set the netmask address.\n\n\n3. **Interaction with other components**: The function interacts with the kernel's network stack to set the netmask address. It does not directly interact with other RDK components.\n\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n   - `ifname`: The name of the network interface for which the netmask address is to be set.\n   - `addr`: The new netmask address to be set.\n   - Return value: The function returns `true` if the netmask address was successfully set, and `false` otherwise.\n\n\n5. **RDK-related operations**: The function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component specifically designed for the RDK platform. It uses RDK-specific functions like `os_nif_ifreq` to interact with the kernel.",
