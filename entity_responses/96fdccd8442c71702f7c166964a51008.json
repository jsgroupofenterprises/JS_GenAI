  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `dppReconfigAuthResponse_callback` function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component in RDK. Its main purpose is to process the DPP (Device Provisioning Protocol) Reconfiguration Authentication Response frame received from a Wi-Fi station (STA).\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nWhen a STA sends a DPP Reconfiguration Authentication Response frame to a Wi-Fi access point (AP), the AP calls this function. The function:\n\n- Logs the reception of the frame with debug information.\n- Retrieves the DPP context associated with the STA based on the AP index and STA MAC address.\n- If the DPP context is not found, it logs an error and returns.\n- Updates the DPP context to indicate that a Reconfiguration Authentication Response frame has been received.\n- Copies the received frame into the DPP context.\n- Pushes the updated DPP context to the data plane queue for further processing.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThis function interacts with the following components:\n\n- Wi-Fi data plane: It uses the data plane queue to remove the DPP context associated with the received frame and to push the updated DPP context for further processing.\n- Wi-Fi Easy Connect (if enabled): It prints debug messages related to the DPP Reconfiguration Authentication Response frame reception.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n|---|---|\n| `apIndex` | Index of the AP that received the frame. |\n| `sta` | MAC address of the STA that sent the frame. |\n| `frame` | Pointer to the DPP Reconfiguration Authentication Response frame. |\n| `len` | Length of the DPP Reconfiguration Authentication Response frame. |\n| Return value | None (void function). |\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThis function uses the following RDK-related operations:\n\n- `data_plane_queue_create_event()`: Creates a new data plane event associated with the DPP context.\n- `data_plane_queue_push()`: Pushes the newly created data plane event to the data plane queue.\n- `data_plane_queue_remove_event()`: Removes the DPP context associated with the received frame from the data plane queue.",
