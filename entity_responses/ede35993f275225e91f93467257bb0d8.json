  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**: The ovsdb_process_event function processes OVSDB (Open vSwitch database) events. It takes a JSON object as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the event was processed successfully.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**: The function first extracts the OVSDB event type from the JSON object. It then branches depending on the event type and performs the appropriate processing. The processing may involve updating the internal state of the CcspWifiAgent component or interacting with other components.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**: The function may interact with other CcspWifiAgent components, such as the OVSDB manager, to process OVSDB events. It may also interact with other RDK components, such as the Wi-Fi HAL, to perform Wi-Fi-related operations.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**: The js parameter is a mandatory JSON object that contains the OVSDB event. The function returns a boolean indicating whether the event was processed successfully.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**: The function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component, which is a RDK component responsible for managing Wi-Fi connections. The function uses the RDK OVSDB manager to interact with the OVSDB database.",
