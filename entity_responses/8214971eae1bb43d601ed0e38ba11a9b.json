  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**:\n   - The main purpose of the process_passpoint_timeout function is to compute GAS (Generic Advertisement Service) query and response rates and update the corresponding statistics. It does this by maintaining a fixed-size window of rate data and calculating the average rates over that window.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n   - The function first checks if it's the first time it's being called. If so, it initializes some variables and gets the current time.\n   - It then checks if the time since the last time it was called is greater than the specified timeout (GAS_STATS_TIME_OUT). If so, it proceeds to calculate the new GAS query and response rates.\n   - It calculates the new rates by subtracting the old rates from the current rates and adding the new rates to the window sum.\n   - It then updates the GAS statistics (QueryRate and ResponseRate) with the calculated rates.\n   - Finally, it updates the current time and moves the window head to the next element.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**:\n   - The function interacts with the GAS statistics data structure to update the GAS query and response rates.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n   - The function takes no parameters and returns void.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**:\n   - The function uses the GAS_STATS_TIME_OUT and GAS_STATS_FIXED_WINDOW_SIZE constants defined in the RDK header file.",
