  "response": "1. Main purpose and functionality:\n   - The `ssp_cancel_wifi` function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component in the RDK framework. Its main purpose is to cancel the Wi-Fi operation, unregister the component, and release any allocated resources.\n\n2. Key operations and data flow:\n   - The function first checks if the `pDslhCpeController` is initialized. If it's not, the function returns `ANSC_STATUS_SUCCESS` to indicate that there's nothing to cancel.\n   - If the `pDslhCpeController` is initialized, the function proceeds to unregister the component by calling `CcspBaseIf_unregisterComponent`. It constructs the component registration name (CrName) and component name (CpName) using the `g_Subsystem` and component name provided in the input parameter `pStartCfg`.\n   - After unregistering the component, the function calls the `Cancel` method on the `pDslhCpeController` to stop any ongoing Wi-Fi operations.\n   - Finally, the function frees the memory allocated for the `pDslhCpeController` and sets it to `NULL`.\n\n3. Interaction with other components (if any):\n   - The function interacts with the CcspBaseIf component to unregister the Wi-Fi component.\n   - It also interacts with the DslhCpeController component to cancel ongoing Wi-Fi operations.\n\n4. Important parameters and return values:\n   - Input parameter:\n     - `pStartCfg`: A pointer to the component configuration structure. It contains the component name used to construct the component registration name.\n   - Return value:\n     - The function returns `ANSC_STATUS_SUCCESS` on success and `ANSC_STATUS_FAILURE` on any error.\n\n5. Any specific RDK-related operations:\n   - The function uses the `g_Subsystem` global variable, which is specific to the RDK framework.\n   - It interacts with the CcspBaseIf and DslhCpeController components, which are part of the RDK framework.",
