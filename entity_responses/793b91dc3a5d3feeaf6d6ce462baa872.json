  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `mon_check_process` function checks the status of a child process and determines if it needs to be restarted or if it exited normally. It also extracts the exit status of the child process.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function first calls `waitpid` to check if the child process has exited. If the child process is still alive, the function returns `true`. If the child process has exited, the function determines the cause of death and extracts the exit status.\n\nIf the child process exited normally, the function returns the exit status of the child process. If the child process was terminated by a signal, the function determines whether the signal was fatal or non-fatal and returns the appropriate exit status.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `mon_check_process` function does not directly interact with other components. However, it may be called by other components to monitor the status of child processes.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* `child`: The PID of the child process to check.\n* `exit_status`: A pointer to an integer variable to store the exit status of the child process.\n* Return value: `true` if the child process is still alive, `false` otherwise.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `mon_check_process` function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
