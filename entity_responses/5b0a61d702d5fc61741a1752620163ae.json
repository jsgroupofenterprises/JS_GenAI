  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**: This code defines callbacks for EthWan link events (link up/down). The RDKB expects these callbacks to be implemented by the application. When the EthWan link goes up/down, the corresponding callback is invoked by the hal component.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**: The key operations are the registration of the callback functions and the invocation of these functions when the EthWan link status changes. The data flow is from the hal component to the application.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**: This code interacts with the RDKB component, which expects the application to implement these callbacks.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**: The important parameters are the function pointers to the callback functions. The return values are not important.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**: This code is specific to RDK and is used to support EthWan link event callbacks.",
