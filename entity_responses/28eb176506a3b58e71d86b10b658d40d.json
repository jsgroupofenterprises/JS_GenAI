  "response": "**1. Purpose of this structure:**\n\nThe `moca_static_info_t` structure is used to store static information about a MoCA (Multimedia over Coax Alliance) network interface. It contains fields for identifying the interface, its MAC address, firmware version, maximum bitrate, supported frequencies, and other capabilities.\n\n**2. Key fields and their significance:**\n\n- `Name`: Name of the MoCA interface, e.g., \"moca0\".\n- `MacAddress`: MAC address of the local MoCA node.\n- `FirmwareVersion`: Firmware version of the MoCA chip.\n- `MaxBitRate`: Maximum PHY rate supported by the node.\n- `HighestVersion`: Highest version of the MoCA protocol supported by the node.\n- `FreqCapabilityMask`: Bitmask indicating the frequencies supported by the node.\n- `NetworkTabooMask`: Bitmask indicating the frequencies not supported by the node.\n- `TxBcastPowerReduction`: Beacon backoff in dB.\n- `QAM256Capable`: Flag indicating if the node supports QAM-256 modulation.\n- `PacketAggregationCapability`: Flag indicating if the node supports packet aggregation.\n\n**3. Usage context in RDK:**\n\nThe `moca_static_info_t` structure is used by the RDK MoCA driver to store information about each MoCA interface in the system. This information is used by the driver to configure the interface and manage network operations.\n\n**4. Related components or interfaces:**\n\n- MoCA driver\n- MoCA network interface\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related details:**\n\n- The `moca_static_info_t` structure is defined in the RDK MoCA API header file (`rdk_moca_api.h`).",
