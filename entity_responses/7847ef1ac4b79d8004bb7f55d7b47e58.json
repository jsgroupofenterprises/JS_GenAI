  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `ovsdb_table_upsert` function is used to perform an upsert (update or insert) operation on a given Open vSwitch Database (OVSDB) table. It takes in an OVSDB socket path, an OVSDB table, a record to be inserted or updated, and a flag indicating whether the existing record's UUID should be updated. The function returns true on success and false on failure.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\nThe function starts by opening a connection to the OVSDB server using the provided socket path. It then constructs an OVSDB request message based on the provided table and record. The request message is sent to the OVSDB server, and the server responds with a reply message. The function parses the reply message to determine the success or failure of the upsert operation.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThe `ovsdb_table_upsert` function interacts with the following components:\n\n- OVSDB server: The function opens a connection to an OVSDB server to perform the upsert operation.\n- OVSDB library: The function uses the OVSDB library to construct and parse OVSDB request and reply messages.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n- `ovsdb_sock_path`: The socket path of the OVSDB server to connect to.\n- `table`: The OVSDB table to perform the upsert operation on.\n- `record`: The record to be inserted or updated.\n- `update_uuid`: A flag indicating whether the existing record's UUID should be updated.\n- Return value: True on success, false on failure.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThe `ovsdb_table_upsert` function is not specific to RDK and can be used in any application that needs to interact with an OVSDB server. However, it is commonly used in RDK applications to manage OVSDB tables related to Wi-Fi configuration and management.",
