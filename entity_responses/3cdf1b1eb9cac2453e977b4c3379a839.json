  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe readFileToBuffer function reads the contents of a file into a buffer. It is used to read the contents of passpoint configuration files.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n* fileName: The name of the file to read.\n* buffer: A pointer to a buffer to store the contents of the file.\n\nThe function first checks if the passpoint configuration directory exists. If it does not exist, the function creates it. Then, the function opens the file specified by fileName. If the file does not exist, the function returns 0.\n\nThe function then gets the number of bytes in the file and allocates a buffer of that size. The function then copies the contents of the file into the buffer. Finally, the function returns the number of bytes that were read.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe readFileToBuffer function interacts with the following components:\n\n* The file system: The function uses the file system to open and read the file specified by fileName.\n* The memory manager: The function uses the memory manager to allocate and free the buffer used to store the contents of the file.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following parameters are important:\n\n* fileName: The name of the file to read.\n* buffer: A pointer to a buffer to store the contents of the file.\n\nThe function returns the number of bytes that were read.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe readFileToBuffer function is used to read the contents of passpoint configuration files. Passpoint is a Wi-Fi Alliance standard that allows users to automatically connect to Wi-Fi networks without having to enter a password. The readFileToBuffer function is used to read the contents of passpoint configuration files, which contain information about the Wi-Fi networks that are available to the user.",
