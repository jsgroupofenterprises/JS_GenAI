  "response": "**Main Purpose and Functionality:**\n   - The ovsdb_table_where function in CcspWifiAgent constructs a WHERE clause for an OVSDB (Open Virtual Switch Database) table based on a given record. It filters rows in the table by comparing the key column of the record with the corresponding field in the database.\n\n**Key Operations and Data Flow:**\n   - Checks if a record is provided and if the table has a non-negative key_offset and a key_name.\n   - If so, it constructs a JSON object representing the WHERE clause using the ovsdb_where_simple function.\n   - The WHERE clause specifies a comparison between the table's key column and the value at the key_offset in the provided record.\n   - If any of the conditions are not met, the function returns NULL.\n\n**Interaction with Other Components:**\n   - Uses the ovsdb_where_simple function to construct the WHERE clause JSON object.\n\n**Important Parameters and Return Values:**\n   - table: Pointer to the OVSDB table object.\n   - record: Pointer to the record containing the key value to match.\n   - Returns: A JSON object representing the WHERE clause, or NULL if any conditions are not met.\n\n**Specific RDK-Related Operations:**\n   - This function is part of the RDK Centralized Configuration and Management (CCSM) OVSDB Adapter module, which is used to manage OVSDB configuration for RDK devices. It is used to filter data in OVSDB tables for specific purposes, such as device provisioning and configuration.",
