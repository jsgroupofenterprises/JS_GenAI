  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\n   The purpose of the `deinit_wifi_data_plane` function is to clean up and deallocate resources associated with the Wi-Fi data plane module in an RDK system. It performs several important tasks to ensure a proper shutdown of the data plane.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n   - The function first calls `deinit_8021x(&g_data_plane_module.module_8021x);` to deinitialize the 802.1X module associated with the data plane. The 802.1X module provides security and authentication mechanisms for Wi-Fi networks. By deinitializing it, the function ensures that any resources allocated to the 802.1X module are released.\n   - It then checks if `g_data_plane_module.queue` is not NULL. If it's not NULL, it means that a queue was created for the data plane module. The function calls `queue_destroy(g_data_plane_module.queue);` to destroy the queue and release the associated resources.\n   - The function proceeds to destroy the mutex and condition variable associated with the data plane module. It calls `pthread_mutex_destroy(&g_data_plane_module.lock);` to destroy the mutex and `pthread_cond_destroy(&g_data_plane_module.cond);` to destroy the condition variable. These synchronization primitives are used to coordinate access to shared resources within the data plane module.\n   - Finally, the function completes the cleanup process and prepares the data plane module for shutdown.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\n   The provided code does not explicitly show interactions with other components. However, the Wi-Fi data plane module is typically part of a larger Wi-Fi management system within the RDK framework. It may interact with other components such as the Wi-Fi control plane, network manager, or device management services.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n   The function takes no parameters and has no return value. It's designed to perform cleanup tasks and doesn't need to return any specific data.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\n   The function uses RDK-specific data structures and functions, such as `queue_destroy()`, `pthread_mutex_destroy()`, and `pthread_cond_destroy()`. These functions are part of the RDK framework and provide platform-specific functionality for resource management and synchronization.",
