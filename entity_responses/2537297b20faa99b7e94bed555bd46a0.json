  "response": "**1. Purpose of this structure**\n\nThe _HALCOSA_DML_ETH_PORT_CFG structure is used to store the configuration parameters for an Ethernet port in an RDK system.\n\n**2. Key fields and their significance**\n\nThe key fields in this structure are:\n\n* **InstanceNumber:** The instance number of the Ethernet port. This number is used to identify the port within the RDK system.\n* **Alias:** The alias of the Ethernet port. This alias is used to identify the port in the user interface.\n* **bEnabled:** A boolean value that indicates whether the Ethernet port is enabled.\n* **MaxBitRate:** The maximum bit rate that the Ethernet port can support.\n\n**3. Usage context in RDK**\n\nThis structure is used by the RDK HAL component to configure Ethernet ports in an RDK system. The HAL component uses the information in this structure to set the appropriate registers in the Ethernet port's hardware.\n\n**4. Related components or interfaces**\n\nThis structure is related to the following components and interfaces:\n\n* **HAL component:** The HAL component is responsible for configuring Ethernet ports in an RDK system.\n* **Ethernet port:** The Ethernet port is a physical interface that allows an RDK device to connect to a network.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related details**\n\nThis structure is specific to RDK and is not used in any other software systems.",
