  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality:**\n\n   - The `hapd_process_assoc_rsp_frame` function is responsible for processing an Association Response (ASSOC_RESP) frame received from an Access Point (AP).\n   - The function forwards the frame to the Host Access Point daemon (HAPD) for further processing.\n\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow:**\n\n   - The function takes four parameters:\n     - `ap_index`: Index of the AP interface that received the frame.\n     - `sta`: MAC address of the station that sent the frame.\n     - `frame`: Pointer to the received frame.\n     - `frame_len`: Length of the received frame.\n\n   - The function forwards the frame to the HAPD using the `ieee802_11_mgmt_cb` callback function.\n\n\n3. **Interaction with other components:**\n\n   - The function interacts with the HAPD to process the received frame.\n\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values:**\n\n   - **Parameters**:\n     - `ap_index`: Index of the AP interface that received the frame. This parameter is used to identify the HAPD instance associated with the AP interface.\n     - `sta`: MAC address of the station that sent the frame. This parameter is used to identify the station that is attempting to associate with the AP.\n     - `frame`: Pointer to the received frame. This parameter contains the actual ASSOC_RESP frame.\n     - `frame_len`: Length of the received frame. This parameter indicates the size of the ASSOC_RESP frame.\n   - **Return value**:\n     - The function returns 0 to indicate successful processing of the frame.\n\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\n   - There are no specific RDK-related operations performed by this function.",
