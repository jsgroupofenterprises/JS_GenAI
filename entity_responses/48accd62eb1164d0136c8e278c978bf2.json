  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe CcspHalEthSwSetAgingSpeed function in the RDK hal component sets the aging speed (in seconds) for the given port on the Ethernet switch. Aging speed is the time after which an entry in the MAC address table of the switch is considered to be invalid and is removed if it is not refreshed by a new packet.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n* PortId: The ID of the port to set the aging speed for.\n* AgingSpeed: The aging speed in seconds.\n\nThe function first checks if the given port is valid. If the port is invalid, the function returns an error. Otherwise, the function sets the aging speed for the given port.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe CcspHalEthSwSetAgingSpeed function interacts with the Ethernet switch driver to set the aging speed for the given port.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* PortId: The ID of the port to set the aging speed for.\n* AgingSpeed: The aging speed in seconds.\n* Return value: The function returns 0 if the aging speed is set successfully. Otherwise, the function returns an error code.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe CcspHalEthSwSetAgingSpeed function is used by the RDK to configure the Ethernet switch.",
