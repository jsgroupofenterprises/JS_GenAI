  "response": "wifi_dpp_t - Wifi DPP\n\n**Description**: Wifi Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP) provides a protocol for securely\nprovisioning Wi-Fi devices using a mobile application. It defines a channel-agile\nhandshake that can operate over both Wi-Fi and other wireless technologies like\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It can also be used to provision devices that don't\nhave a display for user interaction.\n\n**Key Operations**:\n- WPA2 (AES only)\n- SHA256\n- Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) on the NIST P-256 curve\n\n**Data Flow**:\n1. The mobile application generates a public/private ECC key pair.\n2. The mobile application sends the public key to the Wi-Fi device over BLE or Wi-Fi.\n3. The Wi-Fi device generates a public/private ECC key pair.\n4. The Wi-Fi device sends the public key to the mobile application.\n5. The mobile application and the Wi-Fi device use the public keys to generate a shared secret.\n6. The mobile application and the Wi-Fi device use the shared secret to generate a WPA2 encryption key.\n7. The mobile application sends the WPA2 encryption key to the Wi-Fi device.\n8. The Wi-Fi device connects to the Wi-Fi network using the WPA2 encryption key.\n\n**Interaction with other components**:\n- DPP uses the Wi-Fi driver to send and receive packets over the air.\n- DPP uses the Wi-Fi stack to generate and manage WPA2 encryption keys.\n\n**Important parameters and return values**:\n- The `wifi_dpp_t` structure contains the following important parameters:\n  - `version`: The version of the DPP protocol.\n  - `config_method`: The configuration method used to provision the device.\n  - `status`: The status of the DPP operation.\n- The `wifi_dpp_handle` is a handle to a DPP operation.\n- The `wifi_dpp_callback` is a callback function that is called when the status of a DPP operation changes.\n\n**RDK-related operations**:\n- RDK does not define any specific DPP operations.",
