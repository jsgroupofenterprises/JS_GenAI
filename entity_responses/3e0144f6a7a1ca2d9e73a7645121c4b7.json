  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**: \nThe `sendWebpaMsg` function is used to send a Webpa message. It takes a service name, a destination address, a transaction ID, a content type, a payload, and a payload length as input parameters. The function constructs a Webpa message and enqueues it for further processing.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**: \n- The function first checks if any of the input parameters are NULL and returns if any of them are NULL.\n- It then acquires a lock on the `webpa_interface.lock` mutex.\n- It constructs the source address using the device MAC address and the service name.\n- It allocates memory for a `wrp_msg_t` structure and initializes it.\n- It sets the message type to `WRP_MSG_TYPE__EVENT`.\n- It sets the payload, payload size, source, destination, and content type of the message.\n- It enqueues the message in the `webpa_interface.queue`.\n- It signals the `webpa_interface.cond` condition variable.\n- It releases the lock on the `webpa_interface.lock` mutex.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components**: \nThe function interacts with the Webpa agent component, which is responsible for sending Webpa messages.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n- **serviceName**: The name of the service that is sending the message.\n- **dest**: The destination address of the message.\n- **trans_id**: The transaction ID of the message.\n- **contentType**: The content type of the message.\n- **payload**: The payload of the message.\n- **payload_len**: The length of the payload.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**: \nThe function uses the `queue_push` function, which is an RDK-specific function used for enqueuing messages.",
