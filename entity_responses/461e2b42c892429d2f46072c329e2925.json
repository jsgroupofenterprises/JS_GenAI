  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality:**\n    * DPP (Device Provisioning Protocol) is a Wi-Fi Alliance standard that provides a secure and easy way to add new devices to a Wi-Fi network.\n    * DPP uses public key cryptography to establish a secure connection between the new device and the network, and then uses that connection to exchange configuration information.\n    * DPP is designed to be simple to use, even for non-technical users.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow:**\n    * When a new device wants to join a Wi-Fi network, it sends a DPP request to the network.\n    * The network responds with a DPP configuration, which includes a public key and a hash of the network's SSID and password.\n    * The new device uses the public key to encrypt its own credentials, and then sends the encrypted credentials to the network.\n    * The network uses its private key to decrypt the credentials, and then verifies the hash of the SSID and password.\n    * If the hash matches, the network adds the new device to the network and sends it a confirmation message.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any):**\n    * DPP interacts with the following components:\n        * Wi-Fi driver: The Wi-Fi driver provides the low-level functionality that DPP needs to send and receive data over the Wi-Fi network.\n        * Network manager: The network manager is responsible for managing the Wi-Fi network and adding new devices to the network.\n        * User interface: The user interface provides a way for users to interact with DPP and add new devices to the network.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values:**\n    * The following parameters are important for DPP:\n        * **DPP request:** The DPP request message that is sent by the new device to the network.\n        * **DPP configuration:** The DPP configuration message that is sent by the network to the new device.\n        * **Encrypted credentials:** The encrypted credentials that are sent by the new device to the network.\n        * **Confirmation message:** The confirmation message that is sent by the network to the new device.\n    * The following return values are important for DPP:\n        * **RETURN_OK:** The operation was successful.\n        * **RETURN_ERR:** The operation failed.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n    * DPP is supported in RDK by the Wi-Fi HAL.\n    * The following RDK-specific operations are supported by DPP:\n        * **wifi_dppGetCapabilities:** Get the DPP capabilities of the device.\n        * **wifi_dppStartEnrollee:** Start the DPP enrollee process.\n        * **wifi_dppStopEnrollee:** Stop the DPP enrollee process.\n        * **wifi_dppStartConfigurator:** Start the DPP configurator process.\n        * **wifi_dppStopConfigurator:** Stop the DPP configurator process.\n        * **wifi_dppSetOUI:** Set the DPP OUI of the device.\n        * **wifi_dppGetOUI:** Get the DPP OUI of the device.\n        * **wifi_dppSetKey:** Set the DPP key of the device.\n        * **wifi_dppGetKey:** Get the DPP key of the device.\n        * **wifi_dppSetPhaseToUse:** Set the DPP phase to use.\n        * **wifi_dppGetPhaseToUse:** Get the DPP phase to use.",
