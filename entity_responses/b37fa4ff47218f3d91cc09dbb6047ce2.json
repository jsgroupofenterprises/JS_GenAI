  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\nThe `process_easy_connect_event_timeout` function is responsible for handling timeout events related to the Easy Connect protocol, which is used to simplify the Wi-Fi setup process for devices. \n\nThis function checks the current state of the DPP (Device Provisioning Protocol) context and takes appropriate actions based on the state. \nIt attempts to send DPP Authentication Request or Reconfig Authentication Request frames, updates the DPP device context states, and manages the device provisioning process.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\nThe key operations and data flow within this function are as follows:\n- It checks if the STA (Station) was provisioned by the device and retrieves the DPP STA configuration from the database.\n- Based on the current state of the DPP context, it performs the following actions:\n  - If the STA is in the `STATE_DPP_AUTH_RSP_PENDING` or `STATE_DPP_UNPROVISIONED` states, it tries to send a DPP Authentication Request frame. If successful, it updates the DPP device context states and pushes a data plane queue event for further processing.\n  - If the STA is in the `STATE_DPP_RECFG_AUTH_RSP_PENDING` state, it tries to send a DPP Reconfig Authentication Request frame. If successful, it updates the DPP device context states and pushes a data plane queue event for further processing.\n  - If the STA is in the `STATE_DPP_AUTHENTICATED` state, it checks if the DPP Config Request has been received. If not, it updates the DPP device context states and pushes a data plane queue event for further processing.\n  - If the STA is in the `STATE_DPP_CFG_RSP_SENT` state, it checks if the STA is associated with the device. If yes, it updates the DPP device context states and ends the device provisioning process. If not, it checks if the maximum number of retries has been reached. If yes, it updates the DPP device context states and ends the device provisioning process. Otherwise, it updates the DPP device context states and pushes a data plane queue event for further processing.\n  - If the STA is in the `STATE_DPP_AUTH_FAILED` or `STATE_DPP_RECFG_AUTH_FAILED` states, it updates the DPP device context states and ends the device provisioning process.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\nThis function interacts with the following components:\n- Wi-Fi data plane component: It pushes data plane queue events for further processing.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n- `ctx`: Pointer to the Wi-Fi device DPP context.\n- `module`: Pointer to the Wi-Fi easy connect module. (This parameter is not used within the function.)\n- The function has no return value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\nThis function makes use of RDK APIs for Wi-Fi device and data plane operations.",
