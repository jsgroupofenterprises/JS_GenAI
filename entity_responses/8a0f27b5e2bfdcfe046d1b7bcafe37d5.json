  "response": "## 1. Main purpose and functionality\n\nThe voice_hal_setLocalCodecPriority() function in the RDK HAL voice service sets the maximum number of preferred codecs for a given voice service and profile. This allows the device to prioritize certain codecs over others when negotiating with a remote endpoint.\n\n## 2. Key operations and data flow\n\nThe function takes the following parameters:\n\n* `service`: The voice service to be affected.\n* `profile`: The voice profile to be affected.\n* `localCodecPriority`: The maximum number of preferred codecs.\n\nThe function will set the maximum number of preferred codecs for the specified service and profile. This value will be used by the device when negotiating with a remote endpoint.\n\n## 3. Interaction with other components (if any)\n\nThis function interacts with the underlying voice service implementation, which is responsible for negotiating with remote endpoints and managing the audio stream.\n\n## 4. Important parameters and return values\n\nThe following parameters are important to note:\n\n* `service`: The voice service to be affected. This parameter must be a valid voice service identifier.\n* `profile`: The voice profile to be affected. This parameter must be a valid voice profile identifier.\n* `localCodecPriority`: The maximum number of preferred codecs. This parameter must be a valid value.\n\nThe function returns 0 on success, or a negative error code on failure.\n\n## 5. Any specific RDK-related operations\n\nThis function is part of the RDK HAL voice service API, which is a set of functions that provide a common interface to voice services on RDK devices.",
