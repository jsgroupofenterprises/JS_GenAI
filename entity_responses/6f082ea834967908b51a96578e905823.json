  "response": "## Function Overview\n\nThe `platform_hal_GetModelName` function is used to retrieve the model name of the device.\n\n### Key Operations and Data Flow\n\nThe key operation of this function is to retrieve the model name of the device and store it in the `pValue` parameter provided by the caller.\n\n1. The function takes a pointer to a character array (`pValue`) as its only parameter.\n2. It retrieves the model name of the device using internal mechanisms (e.g., reading from a hardware register or configuration file).\n3. The retrieved model name is copied into the `pValue` buffer.\n4. The function returns an integer status code indicating the result of the operation:\n    - `RETURN_OK` if the model name was successfully retrieved and stored in `pValue`.\n    - `RETURN_ERR` if an error occurred during the retrieval or storage process.\n\n### Interaction with Other Components\n\nThis function does not directly interact with any other components.\n\n### Important Parameters and Return Values\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `pValue`: A pointer to a character array where the model name of the device will be stored. The buffer size should be at least 256 bytes long.\n\n**Return Value:**\n\n- `RETURN_OK` if the model name was successfully retrieved and stored in `pValue`.\n- `RETURN_ERR` if an error occurred during the retrieval or storage process.\n\n### RDK-Related Operations\n\nThis function is part of the RDK platform HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) and is used to access hardware-specific information and functionality.",
