  "response": "** 1. Main purpose and Functionality:** \n   - The purpose of this function is to process and handle an association response packet received from a wireless access point(AP), typically in the context of a Wi-Fi association process.\n\n** 2. Key Operations and Data Flow:** \n   - Accepts two parameters:\n    - `assoc_data`: A pointer to a `wifi_assoc_rsp_data_t` struct containing information related to the association response packet.\n    - `module`: A pointer to a `wifi_8021x_t` struct, representing the 802.1X module.\n   - The function processes the association response packet according to the logic within the `#ifdef FEATURE_HOSTAP_AUTHENTICATOR` block. Since the code is commented out, it's unclear what specific actions should be performed on the association response packet.\n   - Lastly, it frees the memory allocated for the data buffer in the `assoc_data` struct.\n\n** 3. Interaction with other components:** \n   - The function may interact with other components depending on the logic within the `#ifdef` block. However, the provided code does not show any direct interactions.\n\n** 4. Important parameters and return values:** \n    - **Parameters** \n        - `assoc_data`: Pointer to a struct containing association response data.\n        - `module`: Pointer to a struct representing the 802.1X module.\n        \n    - **Return Value**\n        - The function does not return any value as it is `void`.\n\n** 5. Any specific RDK-related operations:** \n    - The function does not appear to perform any specific RDK-related operations based on the provided code.",
