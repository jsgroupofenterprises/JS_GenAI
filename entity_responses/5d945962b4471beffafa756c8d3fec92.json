  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**: The `ovsdb_cache_upsert` function in CcspWifiAgent updates or inserts a record into the OVSDB cache. It checks if the record already exists based on its primary key, and if so, it compares the existing record with the new record. If the records are identical, no changes are made. Otherwise, the new record is upserted into the cache and the OVSDB database.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n   - The function takes three parameters: the path to the OVSDB socket, a pointer to the OVSDB table definition, and a pointer to the record to be upserted.\n   - It first checks if the table has a primary key defined. If not, it logs an error and returns -1.\n   - It then finds the existing row in the cache based on the record's primary key.\n   - If the row exists, it compares the existing record with the new record. If they are identical, no changes are made and the function returns 0.\n   - If the row does not exist or the records are not identical, the function converts the record to JSON format and upserts it into the OVSDB database using the `ovsdb_sync_upsert` function.\n   - If the upsert is successful, the function updates the cache with the new record.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components**: The function interacts with the following components:\n   - The OVSDB database to upsert the record.\n   - The OVSDB cache to store the updated record.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n   - **ovsdb_sock_path**: The path to the OVSDB socket.\n   - **table**: A pointer to the OVSDB table definition.\n   - **record**: A pointer to the record to be upserted.\n   - **Return value**: 0 on success, -1 on error.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**: The function is used to upsert records into the OVSDB cache in RDK systems.",
