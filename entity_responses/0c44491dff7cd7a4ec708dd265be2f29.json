  "response": "### DPP (Device Provisioning Protocol)\n**1. Main purpose and functionality**\nDPP is a Wi-Fi Alliance developed protocol that simplifies the process of connecting devices to a Wi-Fi network, particularly for devices that may not have a display or easy input methods. DPP leverages Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to establish a connection between the device and the access point (AP), and then uses that connection to securely provision the device onto the Wi-Fi network.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\nThe DPP process involves the following key operations:\n\n- **BLE Advertisement:** The AP broadcasts a BLE advertisement with the DPP configuration information, including the SSID and security settings.\n- **BLE Connection:** The device initiates a BLE connection to the AP.\n- **DPP Initiation:** The device sends a DPP initiation message to the AP, which includes the device's public key.\n- **DPP Response:** The AP responds with its public key and a nonce.\n- **Key Exchange:** The device and AP perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange to derive a shared secret key.\n- **Network Provisioning:** The AP sends the network configuration (SSID, password, etc.) to the device, encrypted with the shared secret key.\n- **Device Connection:** The device connects to the Wi-Fi network using the provisioned credentials.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\nDPP interacts with the following components:\n\n- **Access Point:** The AP broadcasts the BLE advertisement, receives the DPP initiation message, and responds with the network configuration.\n- **Device:** The device initiates the BLE connection, sends the DPP initiation message, and receives the network configuration from the AP.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\nThe following parameters are important in DPP:\n\n- **SSID:** The name of the Wi-Fi network.\n- **Security Settings:** The security settings of the Wi-Fi network (e.g., WPA2-PSK).\n- **DPP Key:** The public key of the device or AP.\n- **Nonce:** A random value used to prevent replay attacks.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\nDPP is supported in RDK through the `wifi_dpp` HAL API. This API provides the following operations:\n\n- **wifi_dppSetConfiguration:** Set the DPP configuration parameters.\n- **wifi_dppStart:** Start the DPP process.\n- **wifi_dppStop:** Stop the DPP process.\n- **wifi_dppGetStatus:** Get the status of the DPP process.\n- **wifi_dppGetCredentials:** Get the network credentials obtained through DPP.",
