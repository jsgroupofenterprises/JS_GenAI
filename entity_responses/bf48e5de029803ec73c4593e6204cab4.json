DPP uses public key cryptography to establish a shared secret between two devices, which is then used to encrypt the Wi-Fi traffic.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**\n\n   The DPP process begins when a device initiates a connection request to a DPP-enabled access point. The access point responds by sending the device a public key. The device then generates a private key and uses the public key from the access point to encrypt the private key. The encrypted private key is then sent back to the access point.\n\n   The access point uses its private key to decrypt the encrypted private key and generate a shared secret. The shared secret is then used to encrypt the Wi-Fi traffic.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\n   DPP interacts with the following components:\n\n   * Wi-Fi access points\n   * Wi-Fi devices\n   * DPP controllers\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**\n\n   The following parameters are important for DPP:\n\n   * **Public key:** A public key is a cryptographic key that is used to encrypt data.\n   * **Private key:** A private key is a cryptographic key that is used to decrypt data.\n   * **Shared secret:** A shared secret is a cryptographic key that is shared between two devices.\n   * **Return values:** DPP functions return the following values:\n      * **RETURN_OK:** The operation was successful.\n      * **RETURN_ERR:** The operation failed.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\n   DPP is supported in RDK by the Wi-Fi HAL. The Wi-Fi HAL provides an API that allows developers to use DPP to securely establish Wi-Fi connections.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the Wi-Fi HAL to establish a DPP connection:\n\n```c\n   // Create a DPP context.\n   wifi_DPPContext_t *context = wifi_DPPContextCreate();\n\n   // Set the DPP role.\n   context->role = WIFI_DPP_ROLE_ENROLLEE;\n\n   // Set the DPP configuration.\n   context->config.ssid = \"MySSID\";\n   context->config.passphrase = \"MyPassphrase\";\n\n   // Start the DPP process.\n   wifi_DPPStart(context);\n\n   // Wait for the DPP process to complete.\n   wifi_DPPWait(context);\n\n   // Get the DPP result.\n   wifi_DPPResult_t result = wifi_DPPGetResult(context);\n\n   // If the DPP process was successful, connect to the Wi-Fi network.\n   if (result == WIFI_DPP_RESULT_SUCCESS) {\n      wifi_Connect(context->config.ssid, context->config.passphrase);\n   }\n\n   // Destroy the DPP context.\n   wifi_DPPContextDestroy(context);\n```",
