  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\nThe wifi_db_get_harvester_config function is a part of the CcspWifiAgent component in the RDK framework. Its primary purpose is to retrieve the configuration parameters for the Wi-Fi harvester. The Wi-Fi harvester is a component that collects and reports Wi-Fi statistics and measurements.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\nThe function starts by creating a JSON array where statement, which is used to select rows from the Wifi_Global_Config table in the OVSDB database. It then fetches a single row from the table, as the global configuration is expected to be a singleton.\nThe function parses the JSON data from the selected row into a schema_Wifi_Global_Config structure, which represents the global Wi-Fi configuration.\nIt then copies relevant configuration parameters from the schema_Wifi_Global_Config structure into the provided PCOSA_DML_WIFI_HARVESTER structure, which is used to configure the Wi-Fi harvester.\nThe function returns RETURN_OK (0) if successful and RETURN_ERR (-1) if any error occurs during the process.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\nThe function interacts with the OVSDB database to retrieve the Wi-Fi global configuration. It also interacts with the Wi-Fi harvester component by providing it with the necessary configuration parameters.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n- PCOSA_DML_WIFI_HARVESTER pHarvester: A pointer to the structure in which the Wi-Fi harvester configuration will be stored.\n- Return Value: The function returns RETURN_OK (0) if successful and RETURN_ERR (-1) if any error occurs.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n- The function uses the OVSDB database, which is a key component in the RDK framework for managing and storing configuration data.\n- It also interacts with the Wi-Fi harvester component, which is a part of the RDK's Wi-Fi management subsystem.",
