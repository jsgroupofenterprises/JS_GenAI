  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe os_nif_dhcpc_start function in CcspWifiAgent is responsible for starting the DHCP client process on a specified network interface. It sets up the necessary parameters and executes the udhcpc command to obtain an IP address via DHCP.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function begins by checking if the DHCP client is already running on the specified interface. If it is, the function returns immediately.\nIf the DHCP client is not running, the function proceeds with the following steps:\n1. Reads the serial number and SKU from the target device.\n2. Formats the hostname based on the serial number and SKU.\n3. Creates a PID file for the DHCP client process.\n4. Converts the build number and profile name to hexdump format for use as DHCP options.\n5. Formats the DHCP vendor class based on the target model.\n6. Constructs the command-line arguments for the udhcpc command based on the specified parameters and data.\n7. Forks the process twice to disown the DHCP client process.\n8. Waits for the first child process to exit, which should occur immediately.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe os_nif_dhcpc_start function does not interact directly with other components. However, it relies on the udhcpc command to obtain an IP address via DHCP.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* **ifname:** The name of the network interface on which to start the DHCP client.\n* **apply:** A boolean value indicating whether to apply the DHCP settings (true) or run a dry run (false).\n* **dhcp_time:** The time in seconds to wait for the DHCP client to obtain an IP address.\n* **Return value:** A boolean value indicating whether the DHCP client was started successfully.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe os_nif_dhcpc_start function uses the target_serial_get, target_sku_get, target_model_get, and app_build_number_get functions from the RDK library to obtain device-specific information for use in the DHCP request.",
