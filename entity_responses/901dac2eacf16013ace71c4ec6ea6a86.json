  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `ovsdb_table_delete` function in the CcspWifiAgent component of RDK is used to delete a record from an OVSDB table. It takes three parameters:\n\n* `ovsdb_sock_path`: The path to the OVSDB socket file.\n* `table`: A pointer to the OVSDB table structure.\n* `record`: A pointer to the record to be deleted.\n\nThe function first creates a JSON object representing the `where` clause of the OVSDB delete query using the `ovsdb_table_where` function. The `where` clause specifies the conditions that must be met in order to delete the record. The function then calls the `ovsdb_sync_delete_where` function to send the delete query to the OVSDB server. If the query is successful, the record will be deleted from the table.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe key operations performed by the `ovsdb_table_delete` function are:\n\n* Create a JSON object representing the `where` clause of the OVSDB delete query.\n* Send the delete query to the OVSDB server using the `ovsdb_sync_delete_where` function.\n* If the query is successful, delete the record from the table.\n\nThe data flow of the function is as follows:\n\n1. The function is called with the path to the OVSDB socket file, a pointer to the OVSDB table structure, and a pointer to the record to be deleted.\n2. The function creates a JSON object representing the `where` clause of the OVSDB delete query.\n3. The function sends the delete query to the OVSDB server using the `ovsdb_sync_delete_where` function.\n4. If the query is successful, the record is deleted from the table.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `ovsdb_table_delete` function interacts with the following components:\n\n* **OVSDB server**: The function sends the delete query to the OVSDB server using the `ovsdb_sync_delete_where` function.\n* **ovsdb_table_where** function: The function uses the `ovsdb_table_where` function to create a JSON object representing the `where` clause of the OVSDB delete query.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe important parameters of the `ovsdb_table_delete` function are:\n\n* `ovsdb_sock_path`: The path to the OVSDB socket file.\n* `table`: A pointer to the OVSDB table structure.\n* `record`: A pointer to the record to be deleted.\n\nThe return value of the function is an integer. A return value of 0 indicates that the query was successful. A return value of -1 indicates that the query failed.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `ovsdb_table_delete` function is used to delete records from OVSDB tables. OVSDB is a database management system that is used in RDK to manage the configuration of various network devices.",
