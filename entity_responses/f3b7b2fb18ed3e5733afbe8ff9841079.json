  "response": "## Function Overview\nThis function, `voice_hal_setSipDscpMark`, is part of the RDK Voice HAL API and is used to set the DiffServ Code Point (DSCP) mark applied to outgoing SIP packets for a specific voice service and profile.\n\n### Main Purpose and Functionality\nThe primary purpose of `voice_hal_setSipDscpMark` is to configure the DSCP value for SIP packets transmitted from the CPE device. DSCP is a mechanism used in network traffic management to prioritize and classify different types of data packets. By setting the DSCP mark for SIP packets, it allows network devices along the path to allocate appropriate resources and ensure timely delivery.\n\n### Key Operations and Data Flow\n1. The function takes three input parameters:\n   - `service`: Identifier of the voice service for which the DSCP mark is being set.\n   - `profile`: Identifier of the voice profile within the service.\n   - `dscp`: The DSCP value to be applied to SIP packets.\n2. It internally sets the DSCP mark value for the specified service and profile.\n3. The updated DSCP mark is applied to all subsequent SIP packets sent from the CPE for the configured service and profile.\n\n### Interaction with Other Components\nThis function interacts with the underlying VoIP stack or SIP implementation to set the DSCP mark on outgoing SIP packets. It does not directly interact with other external components or modules.\n\n### Important Parameters and Return Values\n- `service`: The voice service identifier that should be modified. If invalid, the function returns `RDK_FAILURE`.\n- `profile`: The voice profile identifier within the service. If invalid, the function returns `RDK_FAILURE`.\n- `dscp`: The DSCP value to be applied to SIP packets. Valid values are typically in the range of 0 to 63. The function returns `RDK_FAILURE` if an invalid DSCP value is provided.\n- Return Value: The function returns `RDK_SUCCESS` if the DSCP mark is set successfully. Otherwise, it returns `RDK_FAILURE` to indicate an error.\n\n### RDK-Related Operations\nThis function is part of the RDK Voice HAL API, which provides a common interface for managing and configuring voice-related functionality across different RDK platforms.",
