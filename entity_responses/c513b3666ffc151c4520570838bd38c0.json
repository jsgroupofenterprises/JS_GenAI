  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n   - The purpose of the ovsdb_sync_delete_with_parent function is to delete a row from an Open vSwitch Database (OVSDB) table with a parent-child relationship.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n   - The function takes several parameters:\n     - `ovsdb_sock_path`: The path to the OVSDB socket.\n     - `table`: The name of the table to delete from.\n     - `where`: A JSON object specifying the where clause for the delete operation.\n     - `parent_table`: The name of the parent table.\n     - `parent_where`: A JSON object specifying the where clause for the parent table.\n     - `parent_column`: The column in the parent table that links to the child table.\n   \n   - The function first logs the delete operation to the debug log.\n   - It then calls the ovsdb_delete_with_parent_res_s function to send the delete request to the OVSDB server.\n   - Finally, it parses the response from the OVSDB server and returns the number of rows that were deleted.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n   - The function interacts with the OVSDB server to perform the delete operation.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n   - `ovsdb_sock_path`: The path to the OVSDB socket.\n   - `table`: The name of the table to delete from.\n   - `where`: A JSON object specifying the where clause for the delete operation.\n   - `parent_table`: The name of the parent table.\n   - `parent_where`: A JSON object specifying the where clause for the parent table.\n   - `parent_column`: The column in the parent table that links to the child table.\n   - Return value: The number of rows that were deleted.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n   - The function uses the OVSDB client library provided by RDK to communicate with the OVSDB server.",
