  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `voice_hal_getTestResult` function retrieves the test result for a specified service, physical interface, and test selector.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes four input parameters:\n- `service`: The index of the voice service.\n- `phy_interface`: The index of the physical network interface.\n- `test_selector`: The name of the GR-909 test to be performed.\n- `test_result`: A pointer to a buffer where the test result will be stored.\n- `pLength`: A pointer to the length of the buffer.\nThe function returns an integer representing the status of the operation.\nIf the operation is successful, the test result is stored in the buffer pointed to by `test_result`, and the length of the test result is stored in the buffer pointed to by `pLength`.\nIf the operation fails, the `test_result` and `pLength` buffers are not modified.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe function interacts with the voice service manager to retrieve the test result.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following table describes the important parameters and return values of the function:\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `service` | uint32_t | The index of the voice service. |\n| `phy_interface` | uint32_t | The index of the physical network interface. |\n| `test_selector` | char * | The name of the GR-909 test to be performed. |\n| `test_result` | char * | A pointer to a buffer where the test result will be stored. |\n| `pLength` | uint32_t * | A pointer to the length of the buffer. |\n| Return value | int32_t | The status of the operation. |\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe function is specific to RDK and is used to retrieve the test results of GR-909 tests performed by the voice service manager.",
