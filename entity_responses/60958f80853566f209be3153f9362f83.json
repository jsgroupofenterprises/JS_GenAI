  "response": "## Summary\nThe `assoc_rsp_frame_sent` function in the `CcspWifiAgent` component handles the sending of an association response frame to a station (STA) that has requested to associate with an access point (AP).\n\n## Key Operations and Data Flow\n1. It allocates memory for and populates a `wifi_assoc_rsp_data_t` structure with information about the association response frame, including the AP index, STA MAC address, response data, and length.\n2. It pushes the `wifi_assoc_rsp_data_t` structure into a data plane queue, which is a mechanism for managing data to be sent over the Wi-Fi network.\n3. The data plane queue is responsible for transmitting the association response frame to the STA.\n\n## Interaction with Other Components\nThe `assoc_rsp_frame_sent` function interacts with the following components:\n1. Data plane queue: The function pushes the `wifi_assoc_rsp_data_t` structure into a data plane queue, which is responsible for transmitting the association response frame to the STA.\n\n## Important Parameters and Return Values\n**Parameters:**\n1. `ap_index`: The index of the AP that received the association request.\n2. `sta`: The MAC address of the STA that requested the association.\n3. `data`: A pointer to the association response frame data.\n4. `len`: The length of the association response frame data.\n\n## RDK-Related Operations\nThe `assoc_rsp_frame_sent` function uses the `data_plane_queue_push` function from the RDK Data Plane Queue API to push the association response frame into a data plane queue.",
