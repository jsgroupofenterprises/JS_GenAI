  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `CosaWifiCreate` function is the constructor for the `COSA_DATAMODEL_WIFI` object, which represents the Wi-Fi data model in RDK. It allocates memory for the object, initializes its common variables and functions, and then calls the `Initialize` function to perform any specific initialization for the Wi-Fi data model.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe key operations performed by the `CosaWifiCreate` function are:\n\n* Allocating memory for the `COSA_DATAMODEL_WIFI` object\n* Initializing the common variables and functions for a container object\n* Calling the `Initialize` function to perform any specific initialization for the Wi-Fi data model\n\nThe data flow of the function is straightforward. It first allocates memory for the `COSA_DATAMODEL_WIFI` object, then initializes its common variables and functions, and finally calls the `Initialize` function to perform any specific initialization for the Wi-Fi data model.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `CosaWifiCreate` function does not interact with any other components directly. However, the `COSA_DATAMODEL_WIFI` object that it creates may interact with other components in the RDK system, such as the Wi-Fi driver or the web user interface.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe `CosaWifiCreate` function does not take any parameters and returns a handle to the newly created `COSA_DATAMODEL_WIFI` object.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `CosaWifiCreate` function is an RDK-specific function that is used to create the `COSA_DATAMODEL_WIFI` object, which represents the Wi-Fi data model in RDK.",
