  "response": "### Main purpose and functionality\n\nThe `platform_hal_getFactoryPartnerId` function is part of the RDK HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) component and is used to retrieve the factory partner ID from the device. The factory partner ID identifies the manufacturer of the device and is typically used for diagnostic and support purposes.\n\n### Key operations and data flow\n\nThe function takes a single argument, `pValue`, which is a pointer to a buffer where the factory partner ID will be stored. The function returns an integer status code indicating whether the operation was successful or not.\n\nThe function retrieves the factory partner ID from the device using platform-specific mechanisms and stores it in the buffer provided by the caller.\n\n### Interaction with other components (if any)\n\nThe function does not interact with any other components directly.\n\n### Important parameters and return values\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n|---|---|\n| `pValue` | Pointer to a buffer where the factory partner ID will be stored. |\n| Return value | Integer status code indicating whether the operation was successful or not. |\n\n### Any specific RDK-related operations\n\nThe function is part of the RDK HAL component and is specific to RDK-based devices.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe factory partner ID is a useful piece of information for diagnostics and support purposes. It can be used to identify the manufacturer of the device and to obtain specific support information from the manufacturer.",
