  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**:\n   - The `wifi_vap_cfg_rollback_handler` function is responsible for rolling back WiFi VAP (Virtual Access Point) configurations to their initial state. This is typically done when a configuration update fails or is aborted.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n   - The function retrieves the initial VAP configurations from the data model.\n   - It then iterates through the current VAP configurations and applies the initial configurations to each VAP, overwriting any changes that were made during the failed update.\n   - Finally, the function applies the initial radio settings to the WiFi device.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components**:\n   - The function interacts with the WiFi data model to retrieve and update VAP configurations.\n   - It also interacts with the WiFi HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) to apply the configurations to the WiFi device.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n   - The function takes no parameters.\n   - It returns `RETURN_OK` if the rollback is successful, or `RETURN_ERR` if any errors occur during the rollback process.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**:\n   - This function is part of the RDK WiFi Agent, which is responsible for managing WiFi configurations and settings on RDK devices.\n   - The function uses the RDK WiFi HAL to apply configurations to the WiFi device.",
