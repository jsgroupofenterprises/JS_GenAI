  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `unpack_files` function unpacks a set of files from a packed data structure. The packed data structure is assumed to be in the format defined by the `pack_hdr` structure, which includes a header with metadata about the packed files, followed by the actual file data.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n* The function first validates the input `pack_hdr` structure to ensure that it is valid and contains consistent data.\n* It then iterates through the files in the packed data structure and unpacks each file into a separate file on the local file system.\n* The function opens each file for writing, writes the file data from the packed data structure to the file, and then closes the file.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `unpack_files` function does not interact with any other components directly. However, it is likely that the packed data structure is generated by another component, such as a packaging tool or a file transfer protocol.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* **`pkthdr`**: The input `pack_hdr` structure containing the metadata and file data to be unpacked.\n* **Return value**: The function returns 0 on success, or -1 on failure.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `unpack_files` function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
