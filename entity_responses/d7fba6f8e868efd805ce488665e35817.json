  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `pjs_basic_to_json` function is used to convert a basic data structure (like an integer, string, or boolean) into a JSON representation. It is part of the CcspWifiAgent component in RDK, which is responsible for managing Wi-Fi networks.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes the following parameters:\n\n* `t_to_json`: A pointer to a function that can convert the data structure to JSON.\n* `t_data`: A pointer to the data structure.\n* `js`: A pointer to the JSON object to which the converted data will be added.\n* `name`: The name of the JSON property to which the converted data will be added.\n* `err`: A pointer to an error message buffer.\n\nThe function first calls the `t_to_json` function to convert the data structure to JSON. It then adds the converted data to the JSON object `js` under the property name `name`.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `pjs_basic_to_json` function does not interact with any other components directly. However, it is used by other functions in the CcspWifiAgent component to convert data structures to JSON.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following parameters are important to note:\n\n* `t_to_json`: The function that can convert the data structure to JSON. This function must be able to handle the specific type of data structure being converted.\n* `t_data`: A pointer to the data structure to be converted.\n* `js`: A pointer to the JSON object to which the converted data will be added.\n* `name`: The name of the JSON property to which the converted data will be added.\n\nThe function returns `true` if the conversion was successful, and `false` otherwise.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `pjs_basic_to_json` function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations. However, it is used by other functions in the CcspWifiAgent component to convert data structures to JSON.",
