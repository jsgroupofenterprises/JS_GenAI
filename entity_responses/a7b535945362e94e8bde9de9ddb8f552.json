  "response": "## **1. Main purpose and functionality** \n\nThe `process_easy_connect_event` function in `CcspWifiAgent` processes events related to the Easy Connect DPP (Device Provisioning Protocol) feature, which is used for simplified Wi-Fi device provisioning. This function handles different states and events in the DPP provisioning process.\n\n## **2. Key operations and data flow** \n\nThe function checks the current state of the DPP session and performs the necessary actions based on that state. It handles events and processes requests or responses related to DPP authentication, configuration, and reconfiguration.\n\nThe key data flow is as follows:\n\n- DPP context initialization and state management\n- DPP authentication request/response processing\n- DPP configuration request/response processing\n- DPP reconfiguration authentication request/response processing\n- Device provisioning state management\n\n## **3. Interaction with other components (if any)** \n\n- Wi-Fi radio: For sending and receiving DPP frames over the air.\n- Data plane queue: For queuing DPP-related events for processing.\n- Wi-Fi DPP database: For storing and retrieving DPP configuration information.\n- Other CcspWifiAgent components: For managing the Wi-Fi network and provisioning devices.\n\n## **4. Important parameters and return values** \n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- **ctx**: Pointer to the Wi-Fi device DPP context.\n- **module**: Pointer to the Wi-Fi easy connect module.\n\nThe function has no return value (void).\n\n## **5. Any specific RDK-related operations** \n\nThe function relies on RDK-specific data structures and functions for Wi-Fi and DPP management, such as those provided by the COSA data model.",
