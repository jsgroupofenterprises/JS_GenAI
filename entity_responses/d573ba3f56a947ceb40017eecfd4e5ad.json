  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**: The `base64_encode` function in the CcspWifiAgent component of RDK is used to encode binary data into a base64-encoded string. Base64 encoding is a method of representing binary data in an ASCII string format that is safe for transmission over networks that may have limitations on the characters that can be transmitted.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**: The function takes as input a binary data buffer `input` of size `input_sz`, and an output buffer `out` of size `out_sz` to store the encoded string. It iterates through the input buffer, converting each chunk of three bytes into four base64-encoded characters. The function uses a lookup table (`base64_table`) to map each 6-bit value to its corresponding base64 character. The encoded characters are stored in the output buffer, and the function returns the size of the encoded string.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components**: The `base64_encode` function is typically used by other components that require a way to encode binary data for transmission over networks or storage in configuration files.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n   - `input`: Pointer to the binary data to be encoded.\n   - `input_sz`: Size of the binary data to be encoded.\n   - `out`: Pointer to the buffer that will store the encoded string.\n   - `out_sz`: Size of the output buffer.\n   - Return value: Size of the encoded string, or -1 if the output buffer is too small.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**: The `base64_encode` function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations. It is a generic function that can be used by any component in the RDK framework.",
