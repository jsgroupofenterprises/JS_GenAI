Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `wifi_assoc_req_frame_callback_register` function is used to register a callback function that will be called when an association request frame is received. This allows the caller to be notified when a device is attempting to connect to the Wi-Fi network.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes a single parameter, which is the callback function to be registered. When an association request frame is received, the callback function will be called with the following parameters:\n\n* `frame` - A pointer to the association request frame\n* `cb_data` - A user-defined pointer to data that will be passed to the callback function\n\nThe callback function should return a value of `wifi_success` if the frame was successfully processed. Otherwise, it should return a value of `wifi_failure`.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `wifi_assoc_req_frame_callback_register` function does not interact with any other components directly. However, the callback function that is registered may interact with other components in order to process the association request frame.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following are the important parameters and return values for the `wifi_assoc_req_frame_callback_register` function:\n\n* **Parameters**\n    * `func` - The callback function to be registered\n* **Return values**\n    * None\n\n**5.
