  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `pjs_int_array_q_to_json` function converts an array of integers into a JSON object with a given name. It is intended to be used within the CcspWifiAgent component.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n- The function takes an array of integers `in_data`, the number of elements in the array `in_num`, a JSON object `js`, a name for the JSON object `name`, and an error message object `err`.\n- It calls the `pjs_generic_array_to_json` function, which converts a generic array of data into a JSON object.\n- The `pjs_generic_array_to_json` function uses the `pjs_int_t_to_json` function to convert each integer element to a JSON string.\n- The resulting JSON object is added to the `js` object with the specified name.\n- If any errors occur during the conversion, they are recorded in the `err` object.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components:**\n\nThe function interacts with the `pjs_generic_array_to_json` function, which is part of the PJS library.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n- `in_data`: Array of integers to be converted.\n- `in_num`: Number of elements in the array.\n- `js`: JSON object to which the converted array will be added.\n- `name`: Name for the JSON object.\n- `err`: Error message object to record any errors.\n- `bool`: Returns true if the conversion was successful, false otherwise.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThe `pjs_int_array_q_to_json` function does not perform any RDK-specific operations.",
