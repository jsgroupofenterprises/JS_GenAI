  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**\n   \n   This function is used to register a callback function that will be called when an associated device is detected.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**\n\n   - The function takes a single parameter, which is a pointer to the callback function to be registered.\n   - The callback function should have the following signature:\n     \n     `void CcspHalExtSw_ethAssociatedDevice_callback(const char *interface, const char *port, const char *mac, const char *ip)`\n     \n     - `interface` is the name of the interface that the device is associated with.\n     - `port` is the port number that the device is associated with.\n     - `mac` is the MAC address of the device.\n     - `ip` is the IP address of the device.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\n   This function does not interact with any other components.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**\n\n   - The only parameter to this function is the pointer to the callback function.\n   - The function does not return any value.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\n   This function is part of the RDKB Software Development Kit (SDK) for embedded devices. The SDK provides a set of APIs for developing applications that run on embedded devices. These APIs include functions for managing network interfaces, configuring Wi-Fi, and interacting with other devices on the network.",
