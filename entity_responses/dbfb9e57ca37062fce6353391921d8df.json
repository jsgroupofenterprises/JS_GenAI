  "response": "**Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe ovsdb_table_upsert_with_parent function in CcspWifiAgent is designed to add or update a record to an OVSDB table while specifying a parent record in a related table. It Ensures that the parent record exists before performing the upsert operation.\n\n**Key operations and data flow:**\n\n- It allows you to specify a parent table and a WHERE clause to identify the parent record, as well as a column name in the parent table to link the records.\n- It first generates a WHERE clause for the table using the provided record and then calls the ovsdb_table_upsert_with_parent_where function.\n- ovsdb_table_upsert_with_parent_where internally combines the WHERE clauses for the table and parent, and performs the upsert operation, creating or updating the record in the table while establishing the parent-child relationship.\n\n**Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\n- It interacts with the OVSDB (Open vSwitch Database) management API.\n\n**Important parameters and return values:**\n\n- Parameters:\n  - ovsdb_sock_path: The path to the OVSDB management socket.\n  - table: A pointer to the OVSDB table definition.\n  - record: A pointer to the record to be upserted.\n  - update_uuid: A flag indicating whether to update the UUID of the record if it already exists.\n  - filter: An optional array of filters to apply to the upsert operation.\n  - parent_table: The name of the parent table.\n  - parent_where: A JSON object representing the WHERE clause for the parent record.\n  - parent_column: The name of the column in the parent table that will be used to link the records.\n- Return value:\n  - Returns true if the upsert operation was successful, false otherwise.\n\n**Specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThis function is used in CcspWifiAgent to manage OVSDB tables related to Wi-Fi configuration in RDK devices. It allows you to create or update Wi-Fi network profiles while linking them to their corresponding APs or devices.",
