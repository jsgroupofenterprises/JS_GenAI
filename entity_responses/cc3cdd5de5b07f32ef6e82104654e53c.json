  "response": "### Function Analysis: ds_tree_node_remove\n\n1. **Main purpose and functionality:**\n\n   The `ds_tree_node_remove` function removes a node from a red-black tree (RDK's implementation of a balanced binary tree) and performs necessary rebalancing operations to maintain the properties of the tree.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow:**\n\n   - The function first checks if the node to be removed is an inner node (with two children) or a leaf node.\n   - If it's an inner node, it finds the previous or next node, which is guaranteed to be a leaf, and replaces it with the current node.\n   - It then calls `ds_tree_remove_leaf` to remove the node from the tree.\n   - If the node is a leaf, it directly calls `ds_tree_remove_leaf` to remove it.\n   - After removing the node, the function performs a series of rebalancing operations to maintain the properties of the tree, using the `ds_tree_remove_rebalance` function.\n   - The root of the tree is always repainted black to ensure that the tree remains a proper red-black tree.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components:**\n\n   This function operates solely within the RDK's data tree implementation and does not directly interact with other components.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values:**\n\n   - `root`: Pointer to the root node of the tree from which the node is to be removed.\n   - `node`: Pointer to the node to be removed from the tree.\n\n   The function has no return value.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\n   - The function uses RDK's data tree implementation, which is based on red-black trees.\n   - It follows the specific rules and algorithms for removing nodes from a red-black tree, as defined by the RDK.",
