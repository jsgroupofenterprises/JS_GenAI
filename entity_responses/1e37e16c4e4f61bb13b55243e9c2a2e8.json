  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**:\nThe `strcmp_len` function is used to compare the length of two strings. It takes four parameters: two character arrays (`a` and `b`) and their respective lengths (`alen` and `blen`) as size_t. The function returns an integer that indicates the difference in length between the two strings. If the strings are of equal length, the function returns the value of `strncmp(a, b, alen)`, which compares the contents of the two strings.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n- The function first checks if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If they are not, the function returns the difference in length.\n- If the strings are of equal length, the function calls the `strncmp()` function to compare the contents of the two strings. The `strncmp()` function returns an integer that indicates the difference in the contents of the two strings.\n- The function returns the value of `strncmp()`.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components**:\nThe `strcmp_len` function does not interact with any other components.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n- `a`: A pointer to the first string to compare.\n- `alen`: The length of the first string.\n- `b`: A pointer to the second string to compare.\n- `blen`: The length of the second string.\n- `Return value`: An integer that indicates the difference in length between the two strings, or the value of `strncmp()` if the strings are of equal length.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**:\nThe `strcmp_len` function is not specific to RDK. It is a general-purpose function that can be used in any C program.",
