  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `wifi_radioBlobSet` function in `CcspWifiAgent` component is responsible for processing and parsing a message pack blob containing Wi-Fi radio configuration data. It extracts the data from the blob and stores it in a `wifi_radio_blob_data_t` structure. \n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n* The function receives a void pointer `data` containing the message pack blob.\n* It decodes the base64-encoded blob and unpacks the message pack data using the `msgpack_unpacked` library.\n* The unpacked data is parsed to extract the Wi-Fi radio configuration data, which includes version and transaction ID.\n* The parsed data is stored in a `wifi_radio_blob_data_t` structure.\n* An `execData` structure is created, which contains the Wi-Fi radio data and other information.\n* The `execData` structure is pushed to a queue for further processing by the execution handler, which will handle the actual configuration of the Wi-Fi radio.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\n* The function interacts with the message pack library for unpacking the received blob.\n* It also interacts with the Wi-Fi configuration manager component through the `PushBlobRequest` function to pass the Wi-Fi radio configuration data for further processing.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* **Parameters:**\n    * `data`: A void pointer containing the message pack blob.\n* **Return values:**\n    * `RETURN_OK` on success, `RETURN_ERR` on failure.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe function is a part of the RDK Wi-Fi agent component and is responsible for handling Wi-Fi radio configuration messages. It uses RDK-specific data structures and functions for processing and managing the Wi-Fi radio configuration data.",
