  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n    The `_c_get_value_by_key` function finds a value in a list of `c_item_t` structures based on a provided key and assigns the value to the provided destination pointer. \n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n    - The function takes as input a list of `c_item_t` structures, the size of the list, a key to search for, and a destination pointer.\n    - It first calls the `_c_get_item_by_key` function to find the `c_item_t` structure that contains the specified key.\n    - If the `c_item_t` structure is not found, the function returns false.\n    - If the `c_item_t` structure is found, the function assigns the value of the `c_item_t` structure to the provided destination pointer and returns true.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n    - The function interacts with the `_c_get_item_by_key` function to find the `c_item_t` structure that contains the specified key.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n    - **list:** A pointer to the list of `c_item_t` structures.\n    - **list_sz:** The size of the list.\n    - **key:** The key to search for.\n    - **dest:** A pointer to the destination where the value will be assigned.\n    - **return:** True if the value was found and assigned, false otherwise.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n    - The function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component of the RDK software stack, which is a set of open source components used to develop and manage connected home devices.",
