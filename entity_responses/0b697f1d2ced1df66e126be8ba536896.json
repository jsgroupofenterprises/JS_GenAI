  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `eapol_frame_received` function handles the reception of an EAPOL (Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN) frame from a Wi-Fi station. It is responsible for creating a 802.1x data structure, copying the EAPOL frame data into the structure, and queuing the structure for further processing.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n* The function takes five arguments:\n    * `ap_index`: The index of the access point that received the EAPOL frame.\n    * `sta`: The MAC address of the Wi-Fi station that sent the EAPOL frame.\n    * `type`: The type of EAPOL frame that was received.\n    * `data`: A pointer to the data portion of the EAPOL frame.\n    * `len`: The length of the data portion of the EAPOL frame.\n* The function first allocates memory for a `wifi_8021x_data_t` structure and initializes the structure to all zeros.\n* The function then allocates memory for the data portion of the EAPOL frame and copies the data from the `data` argument into the allocated memory.\n* The function sets the `vap`, `mac`, `type`, and `dir` fields of the `wifi_8021x_data_t` structure based on the values of the corresponding arguments.\n* Finally, the function calls the `data_plane_queue_create_packet` function to create a data plane packet from the `wifi_8021x_data_t` structure and queues the packet for further processing.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `eapol_frame_received` function interacts with the following other components:\n* The data plane queue: The function queues the data plane packet that it creates for further processing.\n* The Wi-Fi MAC driver: The function receives the EAPOL frame from the Wi-Fi MAC driver.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following parameters are important to the `eapol_frame_received` function:\n* `data`: A pointer to the data portion of the EAPOL frame.\n* `len`: The length of the data portion of the EAPOL frame.\n\nThe function does not return a value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `eapol_frame_received` function uses the `data_plane_queue_create_packet` function, which is an RDK-specific function for creating data plane packets.",
