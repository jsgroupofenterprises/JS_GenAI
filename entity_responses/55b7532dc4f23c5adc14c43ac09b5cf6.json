  "response": "**1. Main Purpose and Functionality:**  \n   - typedef defines various callback functions used in the Wi-Fi Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to handle different types of Wi-Fi frames (management and data) received by the HAL from Wi-Fi devices.\n\n**2. Key Operations and Data Flow:** \n   - These callbacks are invoked by the HAL to notify the registered application or driver about received frames, providing them with the frame information.\n   - The callbacks allow applications to handle and process the received frames as needed.\n\n**3. Interaction with Other Components:** \n   - This typedef is used by the HAL and applications that interact with the HAL to receive Wi-Fi frames and perform necessary processing.\n\n**4. Important Parameters and Return Values:** \n   - The callbacks take various parameters, including the AP index, MAC address of the sender/receiver, frame data, and frame length.\n   - They do not have a return value as they are used for notification and callback purposes.\n\n**5. Any Specific RDK-Related Operations:** \n   - This typedef does not contain any RDK-specific operations. It defines generic callback functions used in the Wi-Fi HAL, which can be utilized by RDK components as needed.",
