  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `libhostapd_global_init` function is responsible for initializing the global state of the hostapd library. This includes setting up the event loop, initializing the random number generator, and allocating memory for the driver private data.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function first checks if the event loop has already been initialized. If not, it initializes the event loop and registers the EAP methods. It then initializes the random number generator and counts the number of enabled drivers. If there are no enabled drivers, the function returns an error.\n\nThe function then allocates memory for the driver private data and returns 0 on success.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `libhostapd_global_init` function interacts with the following components:\n\n* The event loop\n* The random number generator\n* The driver modules\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe `libhostapd_global_init` function takes no parameters and returns 0 on success or -1 on error.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `libhostapd_global_init` function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
