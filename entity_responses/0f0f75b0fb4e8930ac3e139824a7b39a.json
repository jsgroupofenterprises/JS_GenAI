Main Purpose and Functionality\n- Converts a boolean value `in` into a JSON object and adds it to the JSON object `js` with the provided `name`.\n- Handles the case where `in` is non-existent (i.e., `in_exists` is `false`) by adding a null value to `js` instead.\n\n### 2. Key Operations and Data Flow\n- The function calls `pjs_ovs_basic_q_to_json` to perform the actual conversion and addition to `js`.\n- `pjs_ovs_basic_q_to_json` uses a callback function `pjs_bool_t_to_json` to convert `in` to a JSON value.\n\n### 3. Interaction with Other Components\n- No direct interaction with other components is mentioned in the code.\n\n### 4. Important Parameters and Return Values\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `in`: The boolean value to convert to JSON.\n  - `in_exists`: Indicates whether `in` has a valid value (boolean).\n  - `js`: The JSON object to add the converted value to.\n  - `name`: The name of the JSON property to create.\n  - `err`: An error message object for reporting any errors.\n- **Return Value**:\n  - `bool`:\n    - `true` if the conversion and addition were successful.\n    - `false` if there were any errors, which are reported in `err`.\n\n### 5. RDK-Related Operations\n- The function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component, which is used in RDK for Wi-Fi management.",
