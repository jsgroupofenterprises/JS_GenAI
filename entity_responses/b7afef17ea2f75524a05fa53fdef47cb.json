  "response": "## Analysis of moca_dynamic_info_t Structure\n\n### 1. Purpose of the Structure\n\n```\nmoca_dynamic_info_t\n```\nis a data structure that contains dynamic information about the Media Over Coax Alliance (MoCA) network. It provides real-time data on the status, performance, and configuration of the MoCA interface.\n\n### 2. Key Fields and Significance\n\n* **Status:** Indicates the current operational status of the MoCA interface (e.g., Up, Down, Initializing).\n* **LastChange:** Time in seconds since the last status change (e.g., from Up to Down).\n* **MaxIngressBW, MaxEgressBW:** Maximum ingress and egress bandwidths achieved since the last reset.\n* **CurrentVersion:** Version of the MoCA protocol currently being used (e.g., 1.0, 1.1, 2.0).\n* **NetworkCoordinator, NodeID, BackupNC:** Identifiers for the Network Coordinator, local node, and backup Network Coordinator.\n* **PrivacyEnabled:** Indicates whether privacy protection is enabled on the network.\n* **FreqCurrentMask:** Bitmask indicating the allowed operating frequencies for the node.\n* **CurrentOperFreq, LastOperFreq:** Current and previous operating frequencies of the node.\n* **TxBcastRate:** Transmission broadcast rate.\n* **MaxIngressBWThresholdReached, MaxEgressBWThresholdReached:** Flags indicating if the maximum ingress or egress bandwidth thresholds have been reached.\n* **NumberOfConnectedClients:** Number of nodes currently connected to the MoCA network.\n* **NetworkCoordinatorMACAddress:** MAC address of the Network Coordinator.\n* **LinkUpTime:** Duration since the node has been connected to the MoCA network with at least one other node.\n\n### 3. Usage Context in RDK\n\nThe moca_dynamic_info_t structure is primarily used by the MoCA Host Agent (MHA) to monitor and configure MoCA interfaces in RDK devices. It is exposed through the RDK HAL API for access by other components in the system.\n\n### 4. Related Components or Interfaces\n\n* MoCA Host Agent (MHA)\n* MoCA HAL\n* MoCA Network Interface (MNI)\n\n### 5. Specific RDK-Related Details\n\nThis structure is part of the RDK HAL MoCA API. It is intended for use by RDK developers and integrators who need to monitor or manage MoCA networks in their applications.",
