  "response": "**1. Main Purpose and Functionality:**\n\nThe `delimiter_append` function appends a source string (`src`) to a destination string (`dest`) while inserting a delimiter character (`d`) between them, provided there is sufficient space in the destination buffer.\n\n**2. Key Operations and Data Flow:**\n\n- Checks if there is sufficient space in `dest` to append the delimiter and `src`.\n- If there is space:\n    - Calculates the destination string's length and advances the pointer to its end.\n    - Appends the delimiter character.\n    - Advances the pointer again to append `src`.\n- Otherwise, the function exits without making any modifications.\n\n**3. Interaction with Other Components (if any):**\n\nThis function is likely used internally by other RDK components for string manipulation.\n\n**4. Important Parameters and Return Values:**\n\n- `dest`: Pointer to the destination string.\n- `size`: Size of the destination buffer.\n- `src`: Pointer to the source string to append.\n- `i`: Counter indicating the number of times the delimiter has been appended.\n- `d`: Delimiter character to insert.\n- Return Type: `void` (does not return a value).\n\n**5. Any Specific RDK-related Operations:**\n\nThis function does not perform any operations that are specific to RDK.",
