Main Purpose and Functionality\nThe primary objective of the `wifi_receivedAuthFrame_callback` function is to provide a callback mechanism for applications to receive notifications when an authentication frame is received by the Wi-Fi hardware. This callback allows applications to process and handle authentication frames, such as inspecting the frame content, performing security checks, or responding with appropriate frames.\n\n### 2. Key Operations and Data Flow\n* **Registration:** Applications can register their callback function using the `wifi_mgmt_frame_callbacks_register` function, specifying the `wifi_receivedAuthFrame_callback` as the callback for receiving authentication frames.\n* **Trigger:** When an authentication frame is received by the Wi-Fi hardware, the registered callback function is invoked.\n* **Callback Execution:** The `wifi_receivedAuthFrame_callback` function receives several parameters, including the access point index, station MAC address, frame data, and length. The application can then perform necessary processing of the authentication frame, such as verifying credentials or sending a response.\n\n### 3. Interaction with Other Components (if any)\nThe `wifi_receivedAuthFrame_callback` function interacts with the Wi-Fi hardware to receive authentication frames. It does not directly interact with other RDK components or APIs.\n\n### 4. Important Parameters and Return Values\n* **Parameters:**\n    * `ap_index`: Index of the access point that received the frame.\n    * `sta`: MAC address of the station that sent the frame.\n    * `data`: Pointer to the received frame data.\n    * `len`: Length of the received frame data.\n* **Return Value:** This function does not have a specific return value.\n\n### 5. Any Specific RDK-Related Operations\nThe `wifi_receivedAuthFrame_callback` function is part of the RDK Wi-Fi HAL API and is designed to work with RDK-based Wi-Fi devices. It is not specific to any particular RDK component or operation.",
