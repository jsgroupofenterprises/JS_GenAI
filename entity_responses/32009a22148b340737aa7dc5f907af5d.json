  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\nThe `process_eapol_start()` function is responsible for handling the start of an EAPOL (Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN) session in the CcspWifiAgent component of RDK. It processes incoming EAPOL-Start packets and updates the internal data structures to track the EAPOL session state.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\nThe function first checks if the `data->mac` field is set, which indicates that the packet has a valid MAC address. If not, it returns immediately.\n\nIf the packet has a valid MAC address, the function converts the MAC address to a string using the `to_mac_str()` function. It then checks if the `new_event` flag is set, which indicates that this is a new EAPOL-Start event. If the flag is not set, it assumes that the packet is a result of a timeout and returns.\n\nIf the `new_event` flag is set, the function calls `hapd_process_eapol_frame()` to process the EAPOL-Start frame. It then updates the internal data structures to track the EAPOL session state, including adding the STA (Station) to the BSSID's STA map using the `hash_map_put()` function.\n\nFinally, the function logs the receipt of the EAPOL-Start packet and updates the `packet_time` field in the `data` structure.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\nThe function interacts with the following components:\n* `hapd`: The Hostapd component, which is responsible for handling EAPOL authentication and association.\n* `hash_map`: The hash map component, which is used to store the STA map for each BSSID.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\nThe important parameters of the function are:\n* `data`: A pointer to the `wifi_8021x_data_t` structure containing the EAPOL packet data.\n* `module`: A pointer to the `wifi_8021x_t` structure containing the EAPOL module state.\n* `new_event`: A flag indicating whether this is a new EAPOL-Start event.\n\nThe function does not have a return value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\nThe function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
