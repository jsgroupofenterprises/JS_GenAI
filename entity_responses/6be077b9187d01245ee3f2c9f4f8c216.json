  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `daemonize` function in the CcspWifiAgent component of RDK is responsible for detaching the process from its parent, making it a daemon process.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function begins by initializing semaphores for shared processes. It then forks the process, creating a child process. The parent process waits for the child process to finish using a semaphore, and then exits. The child process becomes the main process and continues execution.\nIt then sets a new session ID for the process using `setsid()`. \nFinally, it redirects standard input, output, and error streams to `/dev/null`.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThis function does not directly interact with other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe function has no parameters and no return value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe function uses the `sem_open()` and `sem_unlink()` functions from the POSIX semaphore API, which are commonly used in RDK applications.",
