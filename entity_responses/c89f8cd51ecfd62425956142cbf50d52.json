  "response": "## Function Analysis: os_name_to_pid\n\n### 1. Main Purpose and Functionality\nThe `os_name_to_pid` function in `CcspWifiAgent` maps a process name to its corresponding process ID (PID). It searches through all processes in the system, retrieves their comm files, and compares the contents with the specified process name. If a match is found, it extracts the PID from the file path and returns it.\n\n### 2. Key Operations and Data Flow\n- Checks if a glob pattern for all comm files in the /proc directory can be successfully retrieved.\n- Iterates over the glob results.\n- Reads the contents of each comm file.\n- Compares the file contents with the provided process name.\n- If a match is found, extracts the PID from the file path and converts it to a number.\n- Returns the PID if a match is found, otherwise returns -1.\n\n### 3. Interaction with Other Components\nThe function primarily interacts with the filesystem to access and read comm files of running processes.\n\n### 4. Important Parameters and Return Values\n- `proc_name`: The name of the process whose PID is being sought.\n- Return Value: Returns the PID of the matching process if found, or -1 if not found.\n\n### 5. RDK-Related Operations\nThe function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations and is more generally used for process management.",
