  "response": "**1. Purpose of this structure:**\n\nThe CMMGMT_CM_EventLogEntry_t structure is used to record and store details of events that occur within the RDK Cable Modem Management (CM) component. These events may include errors, warnings, or informational messages related to the operation of the CM subsystem.\n\n**2. Key fields and their significance:**\n\n- **docsDevEvIndex**: An index number that uniquely identifies the event log entry.\n- **docsDevEvFirstTime**: The time at which the event was first detected.\n- **docsDevEvLastTime**: The time at which the event was last detected.\n- **docsDevEvCounts**: The number of times the event has occurred.\n- **docsDevEvLevel**: The severity level of the event (e.g., error, warning, info).\n- **docsDevEvId**: A unique identifier for the event type.\n- **docsDevEvText**: A text description of the event.\n\n**3. Usage context in RDK:**\n\nThe CMMGMT_CM_EventLogEntry_t structure is used by the CM component to generate and manage event logs. These logs provide a historical record of events that have occurred within the CM subsystem and can be used for troubleshooting and diagnostic purposes.\n\n**4. Related components or interfaces:**\n\nThe CMMGMT_CM_EventLogEntry_t structure is closely related to the following components and interfaces:\n\n- **CMMGMT_CM_EventLog_t**: A structure that represents a collection of event log entries.\n- **CMMGMT_CM_EventLogGet**: An API function used to retrieve a list of event log entries.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related details:**\n\nThe CMMGMT_CM_EventLogEntry_t structure is an RDK-specific data structure that is used exclusively within the RDK Cable Modem Management component.",
