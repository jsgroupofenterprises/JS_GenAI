  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `wifi_apply_webconfig_security_params` function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component of the RDK and is responsible for updating the security settings of a Wi-Fi virtual access point (VAP) based on parameters received from a web configuration interface.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n- The function takes as input a `webconf_security_t` struct containing the security parameters to be applied and a `wifi_vap_info_t` struct representing the current VAP configuration.\n- It first checks if the ForceDisableWiFiRadio flag is set, which would prevent any changes to the VAP configuration.\n- It then parses the authentication mode and encryption type from the `webconf_security_t` struct and updates the corresponding fields in the `wifi_vap_info_t` struct.\n- If the authentication mode is set to none, it also disables WPS for the VAP.\n- It also updates the security key passphrase if it has changed.\n- Finally, it checks if the ForceDisableWiFiRadio flag is set and logs a warning if it is, indicating that an attempt was made to change the VAP configuration while the radio is disabled.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThis function interacts with the CosaDmlWiFi component to retrieve the ForceDisableWiFiRadio flag and to update the VAP configuration.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n- `wlan_security`: A pointer to a `webconf_security_t` struct containing the security parameters to be applied.\n- `curr_cfg`: A pointer to a `wifi_vap_info_t` struct representing the current VAP configuration.\n- Return value: The function returns RETURN_OK on success or RETURN_ERR on failure.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThis function is specific to the RDK and is used to update the security settings of Wi-Fi VAPs based on parameters received from a web configuration interface.",
