  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - This function retrieves the web access level for a given user index and interface index. The web access level determines the level of access that a user has to the device's web interface, with 1 being the lowest level and 10 being the highest level.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow:**\n   - The function takes three arguments:\n     - `userIndex`: The index of the user for which to retrieve the web access level.\n     - `ifIndex`: The index of the interface for which to retrieve the web access level.\n     - `pValue`: A pointer to a ULONG variable in which to store the retrieved web access level.\n   - The function first checks if the input arguments are valid. If they are not, it returns an error.\n   - If the input arguments are valid, the function retrieves the web access level from a platform-specific database or configuration file.\n   - The function then stores the retrieved web access level in the memory location pointed to by the `pValue` argument.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any):**\n   - This function may interact with other system components that manage user accounts and permissions.\n   - The function may also interact with the device's web interface to display the web access level for the specified user and interface.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values:**\n   - `userIndex`: The index of the user for which to retrieve the web access level.\n   - `ifIndex`: The index of the interface for which to retrieve the web access level.\n   - `pValue`: A pointer to a ULONG variable in which to store the retrieved web access level.\n   - `RETURN_OK`: The function completed successfully.\n   - `RETURN_ERR`: The function failed to complete successfully.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n   - This function is part of the RDK HAL API, which provides a standard set of functions for interacting with the hardware and software components of RDK devices.",
