  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality:** The `start_ovsdb` function initializes and starts a thread to handle Open vSwitch Database (OVSDB) operations for Wi-Fi management in the RDK framework.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow:**\n    - Initializes Wi-Fi database file descriptors `wifidb_wfd` and `g_wifidb.ovsdb_fd` to -1.\n    - Creates a pthread attribute object `attr` with detached state set to allow thread to run independently.\n    - Creates a new thread `g_wifidb.ovsdb_thr_id` using `pthread_create` to execute the `start_ovsdb_func` function, which initiates OVSDB operations.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components:** The `start_ovsdb` function interacts with the `start_ovsdb_func` function, which establishes a connection to the OVSDB server and handles Wi-Fi-related database operations.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values:**\n    - **Parameters:** None\n    - **Return value:** 0 on successful initialization and thread creation\n\n5. **RDK-related operations:** This function is part of the RDK CcspWifiAgent component, which manages Wi-Fi connectivity and configuration in the RDK environment. It uses OVSDB to manage Wi-Fi database operations, which is an essential component for Wi-Fi configuration and control in RDK.",
