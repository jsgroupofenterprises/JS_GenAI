  "response": "## Function Analysis: sig_handler\n\n### 1. Main purpose and functionality\n- The sig_handler is a signal handler that handles various signals. \n- When a signal is received, it performs specific actions based on the type of signal, such as printing a message, resetting the signal handler, or exiting the program.\n\n### 2. Key operations and data flow\n- When a signal is received, the sig_handler function is called with the signal number as an argument.\n- The function checks the signal number and performs the appropriate action based on the signal type.\n- The function then resets the signal handler for the received signal.\n- If the signal is not recognized, the function prints a stack trace and exits the program.\n\n### 3. Interaction with other components (if any)\n- The function uses the CcspTraceInfo function to print messages to the trace log.\n- The function calls the _print_stack_backtrace function to print a stack trace if an unrecognized signal is received.\n\n### 4. Important parameters and return values\n- The function takes a single parameter: sig, which is the signal number that was received\n- The function does not return any value.\n\n### 5. Any specific RDK-related operations\n- The function does not perform any RDK-specific operations.\n- It is part of the CcspWifiAgent component, which is used for managing Wi-Fi connections in RDK devices.",
