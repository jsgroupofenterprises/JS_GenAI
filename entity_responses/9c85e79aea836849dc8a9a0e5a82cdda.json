  "response": "1. Main purpose and functionality:\n    - The `ovsdb_table_delete_simple` function in RDK's CcspWifiAgent is used to delete a row from an OVSDB table based on a simple condition. It simplifies the process of deleting a row by taking care of creating the necessary JSON request and sending it to the OVSDB server.\n\n2. Key operations and data flow:\n    - The function begins by creating a JSON object (`where`) that represents the condition for the deletion. This object is created using the `ovsdb_where_simple` function.\n    - It then calls the `ovsdb_sync_delete_where` function to send the JSON request to the OVSDB server. This function handles the communication with the server and waits for the response.\n    - If the deletion is successful, `ovsdb_sync_delete_where` returns 0; otherwise, it returns a negative error code.\n\n3. Interaction with other components (if any):\n    - The `ovsdb_table_delete_simple` function depends on the `ovsdb_where_simple` and `ovsdb_sync_delete_where` functions for its operation. It may interact with other components that use OVSDB for data management.\n\n4. Important parameters and return values:\n    - `ovsdb_sock_path`: The path to the OVSDB socket.\n    - `table`: A pointer to the OVSDB table from which a row should be deleted.\n    - `column`: The name of the column to check for the deletion condition.\n    - `value`: The value to match in the specified column.\n    - Return value: The function returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure.\n\n5. Any specific RDK-related operations:\n    - The `ovsdb_table_delete_simple` function is specifically designed for use in the RDK environment, where OVSDB is used as a centralized data management solution. It simplifies the task of deleting rows from OVSDB tables, which is a common operation in RDK-based systems.",
