  "response": "## wifi_pushCountryCode Function Analysis\n\n### 1. Main Purpose and Functionality\n\n* The `wifi_pushCountryCode` function is responsible for pushing the specified country code to the Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) radio. \n* It configures the AP to operate in compliance with the regulations and restrictions of the specified country.\n\n### 2. Key Operations and Data Flow\n\n* Accepts a country code string as an input parameter.\n* Sends a request to the Wi-Fi AP radio firmware to set the country code.\n* The AP radio updates its configuration and starts operating according to the specified country code.\n\n### 3. Interaction with Other Components\n\n* Typically interacts with the Wi-Fi AP radio firmware to configure the country code setting.\n* May also interact with higher-level components in the RDK software stack that manage Wi-Fi settings.\n\n### 4. Important Parameters and Return Values\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n* `CountryCode`: A character string representing the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code to be applied.\n\n**Return Value:**\n\n* `INT`:\n    * A zero (0) indicates success.\n    * A non-zero value indicates an error.\n\n### 5. Specific RDK-Related Operations\n\n* The `wifi_pushCountryCode` function is part of the RDK Wi-Fi HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) interface, which provides a common API for managing Wi-Fi hardware across different vendor platforms.\n* It is intended for use within RDK-based software environments and is designed to facilitate the configuration and management of country code settings for Wi-Fi APs.",
