  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe os_nif_dhcpc_pid function in CcspWifiAgent determines the process ID (PID) of the DHCP client (dhcpc) process running on the specified network interface (ifname).\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n- The function first constructs the expected path for the dhcpc PID file based on the given interface name.\n- It opens the file and attempts to read the PID value.\n- If the file exists and the PID is successfully obtained, it checks if the process with the specified PID is still running by sending a signal.\n- If the process is running, the function returns the PID; otherwise, it returns 0.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components:**\n\nThe function does not directly interact with other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n- **Parameters:**\n   - char *ifname: The name of the network interface for which the dhcpc PID is required.\n- **Return value:**\n   - static int: The PID of the dhcpc process running on the specified interface, or 0 if no such process exists.\n\n**5. Specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThe function does not perform any RDK-specific operations.",
