  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\n   The purpose of this function is to convert a given radio name to its corresponding index. The index is used to identify the radio in other RDK functions and components.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n   The function takes two parameters: a pointer to an integer variable that will store the index, and a pointer to a character array that contains the radio name.\n   The function compares the radio name to the strings \"radio1\" and \"radio2\". If the name matches \"radio1\", the function sets the index to 1 and returns 0. If the name matches \"radio2\", the function sets the index to 2 and returns 0.\n   If the name does not match either \"radio1\" or \"radio2\", the function returns -1.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\n   This function is used by other RDK components that need to identify a radio by its index. For example, the CcspWifiAgent uses this function to convert the radio name provided by the user to an index that can be used to identify the radio in the OVSDB database.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n   * **index**: A pointer to an integer variable that will store the index of the radio.\n   * **name**: A pointer to a character array that contains the name of the radio.\n   * **Return value**: The function returns 0 if the conversion was successful, or -1 if the name did not match any known radio name.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\n   This function uses the BUFFER_LENGTH_OVSDB constant to determine the maximum length of the radio name string. This constant is defined in the RDK header file ovsdb_client.h.",
