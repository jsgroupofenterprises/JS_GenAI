  "response": "## Main Purpose and Functionality\nThe `wifi_setApVlanID` function sets the VLAN ID for the specified Access Point (AP) within an internal environment variable. This VLAN ID can later be used to configure VLAN-related settings for the AP.\n\n## Key Operations and Data Flow\n1. The function takes two parameters:\n    - `apIndex`: The index of the target AP.\n    - `vlanId`: The VLAN ID to be assigned to the AP.\n2. The function sets the `vlanId` parameter in an internal environment variable, which is used by other functions and components to configure VLAN-related settings for the AP.\n\n## Interaction with Other Components\nThis function interacts with other components responsible for managing VLANs and network connectivity. It provides these components with the VLAN ID assigned to the AP, allowing them to configure the necessary network settings.\n\n## Important Parameters and Return Values\n- `apIndex`: Specifies the index of the AP for which the VLAN ID is to be set.\n- `vlanID`: Specifies the VLAN ID to be assigned to the AP.\n- Return Value: The function returns `RETURN_OK` if the operation is successful and `RETURN_ERR` if any error is encountered.\n\n## RDK-Related Operations\nThis function is used in conjunction with other RDK HAL functions to configure VLAN-related settings for APs in an RDK-based system. It provides a centralized way to manage and configure VLANs for Wi-Fi networks.",
