  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality** \n\nThe ert_dhcp6c_get_info function in the RDK hal component extracts the ECM (Enhanced Cable Modem) information from the DHCPv6 (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6) client and stores it in a dhcp6cInfo_t structure. This function enables developers to retrieve crucial information such as the interface name, DHCP state, configuration attempts, IPv6 address, and other relevant details about the DHCPv6 client.\n\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\na. The function starts by taking a dhcp6cInfo_t structure as an input parameter. This structure is expected to be pre-allocated and passed by the caller.\n\nb. It then invokes the ecm_dhcp6c_get_info() function from the ecm component. This function is responsible for retrieving the ECM information from the DHCPv6 client.\n\nc. The ecm_dhcp6c_get_info() function fills up the dhcp6cInfo_t structure with the following information:\n   - ifname: Interface name (e.g., \"wan0\")\n   - smState: DHCP state (e.g., 6 for RENEW)\n   - configAttempts: Number of configuration attempts made\n   - ipAddr: IPv6 address assigned to the interface\n\nd. Finally, the ert_dhcp6c_get_info() function returns an integer, indicating the status of the operation. A successful operation returns 0, while a negative value indicates an error.\n\n\n**3. Interaction with other components**\n\nThe ert_dhcp6c_get_info() function interacts with the following components:\n\n- ecm: This component provides the core functionality for managing the ECM. The ecm_dhcp6c_get_info() function in this component is responsible for retrieving the DHCPv6 client information.\n\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n- **Input parameters:**\n   - pInfo: A pointer to a dhcp6cInfo_t structure.\n- **Return value:**\n   - 0: Success\n   - Negative value: Error\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe ert_dhcp6c_get_info() function is an RDK-specific function that is designed to work with the RDK framework. It provides a convenient way to retrieve ECM information from the DHCPv6 client in an RDK environment.",
