  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**: The `dppConfigResult_callback` function is called by the DPP agent to handle the DPP configuration result frame received from the AP. It parses the received frame, stores it in the DPP context, and pushes the context to the data plane queue for further processing.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n   - The function takes the AP index, station MAC address, received frame, and frame length as input parameters.\n   - It creates a match criteria using the AP index and station MAC address to find the corresponding DPP context in the data plane queue.\n   - If the context is found, it updates the context with the received frame and pushes it back to the data plane queue.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components**: The function interacts with the DPP agent and the data plane queue.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n   - `apIndex`: The index of the AP that sent the DPP configuration result frame.\n   - `sta`: The MAC address of the station that received the DPP configuration result frame.\n   - `frame`: The received DPP configuration result frame.\n   - `len`: The length of the received DPP configuration result frame.\n   - `ctx`: The DPP context that is updated with the received frame.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**: The function uses the RDK data plane queue to store and retrieve the DPP context.",
