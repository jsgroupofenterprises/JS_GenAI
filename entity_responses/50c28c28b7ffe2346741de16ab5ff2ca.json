  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `free_str_pair` function is a utility function used to free the memory allocated for a `str_pair` struct. A `str_pair` is a data structure that holds a key-value pair of strings.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function first checks if the `pair` argument is NULL. If it is, the function simply returns without doing anything.\n\nIf the `pair` argument is not NULL, the function frees each of the three members: the `key` member, the `value` member, and the `pair` struct itself. The order in which these members are freed is important, as the `key` and `value` members are allocated individually, while the `pair` struct is allocated as a whole.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `free_str_pair` function does not interact with any other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe only parameter to the `free_str_pair` function is the `pair` argument, which is a pointer to the `str_pair` struct to be freed.\n\nThe function has no return value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `free_str_pair` function is not specific to RDK. It is a generic utility function that can be used in any C program.",
