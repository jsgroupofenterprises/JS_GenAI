  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `wifi_get_initial_radio_config` function retrieves the initial configuration for the specified radio index. The configuration includes information such as whether the radio is enabled, the operating frequency band, and other settings.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n- The function first obtains a pointer to the `PCOSA_DATAMODEL_WIFI` object, which represents the Wi-Fi subsystem.\n- It then gets a pointer to the `PCOSA_DML_WIFI_RADIO` object for the specified radio index.\n- The function then gets a pointer to the `PCOSA_DML_WIFI_RADIO_FULL` object, which contains the complete configuration for the radio.\n- The function copies the configuration from the `PCOSA_DML_WIFI_RADIO_FULL` object to the `wifi_radio_operationParam_t` object.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe function interacts with the following components:\n\n- The Wi-Fi subsystem (represented by the `PCOSA_DATAMODEL_WIFI` object)\n- The Radio Manager (represented by the `PCOSA_DML_WIFI_RADIO` object)\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n- `curr_cfg`: A pointer to the `wifi_radio_operationParam_t` object to be populated with the initial radio configuration.\n- `radio_index`: The index of the radio for which the configuration is being retrieved.\n- Return value: The function returns `RETURN_OK` if successful, or `RETURN_ERR` if there was an error retrieving the configuration.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
