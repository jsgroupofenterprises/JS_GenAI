  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `ovsdb_table_upsert_with_parent_where` function in CcspWifiAgent is used to upsert (update or insert) a record into an Open vSwitch Database (OVSDB) table with a parent-child relationship.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes the following parameters:\n\n* `ovsdb_sock_path`: Path to the Unix socket used to communicate with the OVSDB server.\n* `table`: Pointer to the OVSDB table definition.\n* `where`: JSON object representing the where clause to use when searching for the record.\n* `record`: Pointer to the data to be upserted into the table.\n* `update_uuid`: Boolean indicating whether the record's UUID should be updated.\n* `filter`: Array of strings representing the fields to include in the JSON representation of the record.\n* `parent_table`: Name of the parent table.\n* `parent_where`: JSON object representing the where clause to use when searching for the parent record.\n* `parent_column`: Name of the column in the parent table that references the child table.\n\nThe function first converts the record to a JSON object using the `ovsdb_table_to_json_f` function. It then calls the `ovsdb_sync_upsert_with_parent` function to perform the upsert operation. The `ovsdb_sync_upsert_with_parent` function sends the JSON representation of the record to the OVSDB server, along with the where clause and parent table information. The OVSDB server updates or inserts the record accordingly.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `ovsdb_table_upsert_with_parent_where` function interacts with the OVSDB server through the Unix socket specified in the `ovsdb_sock_path` parameter.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* The `table` parameter is important because it defines the schema of the table that the record will be upserted into.\n* The `record` parameter is important because it contains the data that will be upserted into the table.\n* The `where` parameter is important because it specifies the conditions that must be met in order for the upsert operation to be performed.\n* The `parent_table` parameter is important because it specifies the name of the parent table that the child table is related to.\n* The `parent_where` parameter is important because it specifies the conditions that must be met in order to find the parent record.\n* The `parent_column` parameter is important because it specifies the name of the column in the parent table that references the child table.\n* The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the upsert operation was successful.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `ovsdb_table_upsert_with_parent_where` function is used in RDK to manage OVSDB tables that have parent-child relationships. For example, it is used to manage the `WIFI.Radios` table, which has a parent-child relationship with the `WIFI.Interfaces` table.",
