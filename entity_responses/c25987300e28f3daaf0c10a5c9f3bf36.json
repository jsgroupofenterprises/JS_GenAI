  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `deviceConnectHandler` function is an event handler for the `Device.WiFi.AccessPoint.%d.X_RDK_deviceConnected` event. This event is triggered when a new device connects to an access point on the Wi-Fi network. The function's purpose is to extract information about the connected device from the event and print it to the log.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe key operations performed by the function are as follows:\n\n1. It parses the event name to extract the access point number (`vap`). This parameter is used to identify the access point that the device connected to.\n2. It retrieves the value of the `Device.WiFi.AccessPoint.%d.X_RDK_deviceConnected` property from the event data. This property contains the MAC address of the connected device.\n3. It converts the value of the property to a MAC address structure.\n4. It prints the MAC address of the connected device and the access point number to the log.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe function interacts with the following components:\n\n* The RDK RBUS library\n* The Wi-Fi agent\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following parameters are important:\n\n* `handle`: The RBUS handle.\n* `event`: The RBUS event.\n* `subscription`: The RBUS event subscription.\n\nThe function does not return any value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe function uses the following RDK-specific operations:\n\n* The `rbusObject_GetValue()` function to retrieve the value of a property from an RBUS object.\n* The `rbusValue_GetBytes()` function to convert an RBUS value to a byte array.",
