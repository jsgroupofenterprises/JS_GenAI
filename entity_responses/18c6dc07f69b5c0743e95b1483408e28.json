  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `set_dpp_device_context_states` function is responsible for setting the DPP (Device Provisioning Protocol) device context states. It updates the `wifi_device_dpp_context_t` structure with the provided DPP state, activation status, enrollee status, and DPP STA configuration.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n- The function takes a `wifi_device_dpp_context_t` pointer, which contains the current DPP device context.\n- It updates the `state`, `activation_status`, and `enrollee_status` members of the DPP device context with the provided values.\n- It copies the `ActivationStatus` and `EnrolleeResponderStatus` strings from the DPP STA configuration into the DPP device context.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThe function does not directly interact with any other components. However, the updated DPP device context may be used by other RDK components that manage DPP operations.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n- `wifi_device_dpp_context_t *ctx`: Pointer to the DPP device context to be updated.\n- `wifi_dpp_state_t state`: The new DPP state to be set.\n- `wifi_activation_status_t activation_status`: The new activation status to be set.\n- `wifi_enrollee_responder_status_t enrollee_status`: The new enrollee responder status to be set.\n- `PCOSA_DML_WIFI_DPP_STA_CFG pWifiDppSta`: Pointer to the DPP STA configuration containing the `ActivationStatus` and `EnrolleeResponderStatus` strings.\n\nThe function has no explicit return value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThe function makes use of RDK-specific data structures and constants, such as `PCOSA_DML_WIFI_DPP_STA_CFG` and `acti_status`.",
