  "response": "**1. Purpose of this structure:**\n\nThe `_HALCOSA_DML_ETH_STATS` structure in the RDK is used to store various Ethernet statistics for a given network interface.\n\n**2. Key fields and their significance:**\n\n* **BytesSent**: Number of bytes sent on the interface.\n* **BytesReceived**: Number of bytes received on the interface.\n* **PacketsSent**: Number of packets sent on the interface.\n* **PacketsReceived**: Number of packets received on the interface.\n* **ErrorsSent**: Number of errors encountered while sending packets on the interface.\n* **ErrorsReceived**: Number of errors encountered while receiving packets on the interface.\n* **UnicastPacketsSent**: Number of unicast packets sent on the interface.\n* **UnicastPacketsReceived**: Number of unicast packets received on the interface.\n* **DiscardPacketsSent**: Number of packets discarded while sending on the interface.\n* **DiscardPacketsReceived**: Number of packets discarded while receiving on the interface.\n* **MulticastPacketsSent**: Number of multicast packets sent on the interface.\n* **MulticastPacketsReceived**: Number of multicast packets received on the interface.\n* **BroadcastPacketsSent**: Number of broadcast packets sent on the interface.\n* **BroadcastPacketsReceived**: Number of broadcast packets received on the interface.\n* **UnknownProtoPacketsReceived**: Number of packets received with an unknown protocol.\n\n**3. Usage context in RDK:**\n\nThis structure is typically used by RDK components that need to obtain Ethernet statistics for a given network interface. For example, the `eth_stats` command in the RDK command-line interface uses this structure to display Ethernet statistics for a specified interface.\n\n**4. Related components or interfaces:**\n\n* The `_HALCOSA_DML_ETH_STATS` structure is related to the `HALCOSA_DML_ETH` interface, which provides functions for managing Ethernet interfaces.\n* This structure can be used by various RDK applications that require access to Ethernet statistics, such as network monitoring tools and performance analysis applications.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related details:**\n\nThis structure is specific to the RDK and is not part of the standard C library. It is defined in the `halcosa_dml_eth.h` header file, which is included in the RDK software development kit (SDK).",
