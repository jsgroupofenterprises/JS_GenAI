  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP) is a Wi-Fi Alliance standard that provides a simple and secure way to add new devices to a Wi-Fi network. DPP uses public key cryptography to establish a secure connection between a new device and an existing access point (AP).\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe DPP process begins when a new device sends a DPP configuration request to an AP. The AP responds with a DPP configuration response, which includes a public key and a hash of the AP's SSID. The new device then generates a private key and a public key, and it sends the public key to the AP. The AP uses the public key to encrypt a message that contains the SSID and password. The new device decrypts the message using its private key and connects to the AP.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nDPP can be used with any Wi-Fi device that supports the protocol. DPP is supported in the following RDK components:\n\n* **Wi-Fi driver:** The Wi-Fi driver provides the basic functionality needed to support DPP.\n* **Wi-Fi HAL:** The Wi-Fi HAL provides a higher-level interface to the Wi-Fi driver. The Wi-Fi HAL includes a set of functions that can be used to implement DPP.\n* **Wi-Fi stack:** The Wi-Fi stack provides a complete set of functions that can be used to implement DPP.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following parameters are used in the DPP process:\n\n* **DPP configuration request:** A message that is sent by a new device to an AP. The message includes the device's public key.\n* **DPP configuration response:** A message that is sent by an AP to a new device. The message includes the AP's public key and a hash of the AP's SSID.\n* **DPP public key:** A public key that is used to encrypt messages.\n* **DPP private key:** A private key that is used to decrypt messages.\n* **SSID:** The name of the Wi-Fi network.\n* **Password:** The password for the Wi-Fi network.\n\nThe following return values can be returned by the Wi-Fi HAL functions that are used to implement DPP:\n\n* **RETURN_OK:** The operation was successful.\n* **RETURN_ERR:** The operation failed.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe following RDK-related operations are supported by DPP:\n\n* **DPP over Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS):** DPP can be used over WPS to add new devices to a Wi-Fi network.\n* **DPP over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE):** DPP can be used over BLE to add new devices to a Wi-Fi network.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nDPP is a simple and secure way to add new devices to a Wi-Fi network. DPP is supported in the following RDK components: Wi-Fi driver, Wi-Fi HAL, and Wi-Fi stack. DPP can be used over WPS or BLE.",
