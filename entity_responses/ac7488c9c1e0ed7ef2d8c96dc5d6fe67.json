  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - The CosaLoggingRemove function in the CcspWifiAgent component is responsible for removing (destroying) a previously created CosaLogging object.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n   - The function first casts the input hThisObject handle to a PCOSA_DATAMODEL_LOGGING pointer, which is the type of the object being removed.\n   - It then frees the allocated memory for the pLogging object, which contains the logging configuration and other data associated with the CosaLogging object.\n   - Finally, it frees the memory for the pMyObject object itself, which is the instance of the CosaLogging object being removed.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n   - The function does not interact directly with other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n   - hThisObject: Handle to the CosaLogging object being removed.\n   - returnStatus: ANSC_STATUS indicating the result of the remove operation.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n   - The function uses the AnscFreeMemory() function, which is an RDK-specific memory management function.",
