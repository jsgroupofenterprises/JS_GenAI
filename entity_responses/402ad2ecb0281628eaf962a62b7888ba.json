  "response": "**Analysis of dppAuthResponse_callback**\n\n**Main purpose and Functionality**\n\nThe dppAuthResponse_callback function is responsible for handling DPP (Device Provisioning Protocol) authorization response messages from a Wi-Fi device. It is invoked when a DPP authorization response frame is received from the Wi-Fi device.\n\n**Key Operations and Data Flow**\n\n1. The function receives the following parameters:\n   - apIndex: Index of the Access Point (AP)\n   - sta: MAC address of the STA (Station)\n   - frame: Pointer to the received DPP authorization response frame\n   - len: Length of the received frame\n2. It searches for a matching DPP context in a data plane queue using the provided apIndex and STA MAC address.\n3. If a matching context is found, it sets the context type to 'dpp_context_type_received_frame_auth_rsp'.\n4. It allocates memory and copies the received frame into the context.\n5. It pushes the updated context back into the data plane queue.\n\n**Interaction with other Components**\n\nThe dppAuthResponse_callback function interacts with the following components:\n\n- **data_plane_queue:** Manages the data plane queue for DPP events.\n- **wifi_easy_connect_dbg_print:** Used for debug logging.\n\n**Important Parameters and Return Values**\n\n- **Parameters:**\n   - apIndex: Index of the AP\n   - sta: MAC address of the STA\n   - frame: Pointer to the received DPP authorization response frame\n   - len: Length of the received frame\n\n**RDK-related Operations**\n\nThe function uses the following RDK-specific operations:\n\n- **data_plane_queue_remove_event:** Removes an event from the data plane queue.\n- **data_plane_queue_push:** Pushes an event into the data plane queue.\n- **data_plane_queue_create_event:** Creates an event for the data plane queue.",
