  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe CosaWifiRegGetSsidInfo function in the CcspWifiAgent component is responsible for getting SSID (Service Set Identifier) information from the data model and populating it into a queue. This information includes SSID names, aliases, and instance numbers.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function first checks if the IREP (Internet Routing and Encapsulation Protocol) folder object for Wi-Fi SSIDs is valid. If not, it returns an error.\n\nNext, it loads any newly added but not yet committed SSID entries from the IREP folder. It iterates through these entries, extracting the SSID name, alias, and instance number.\n\nFor each SSID entry, it creates a Cosa context link object and a corresponding COSA DML Wi-Fi SSID object. The Cosa context link object stores information about the SSID, including its handle, parent table, instance number, and IREP folder objects. The COSA DML Wi-Fi SSID object contains the actual SSID data, such as the SSID name, alias, and configuration settings.\n\nFinally, the function pushes the Cosa context link object into a queue within the COSA_DATAMODEL_WIFI object. This queue is used to track SSIDs that need to be processed by the Wi-Fi agent.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe CosaWifiRegGetSsidInfo function interacts with the following components:\n\n* COSA_DATAMODEL_WIFI: The main data model object for Wi-Fi.\n* POAM_IREP_FOLDER_OBJECT: The IREP folder object for Wi-Fi SSIDs.\n* COSA_CONTEXT_LINK_OBJECT: A data structure used to store information about data model objects and their relationships.\n* COSA_DML_WIFI_SSID: A data structure representing a Wi-Fi SSID.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* **hThisObject:** The handle to the COSA_DATAMODEL_WIFI object.\n* **Return value:** ANSC_STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation was successful, ANSC_STATUS_FAILURE otherwise.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThis function is used in the RDK to collect SSID information from the data model and make it available to the Wi-Fi agent. The Wi-Fi agent uses this information to manage Wi-Fi networks and provide Wi-Fi connectivity to devices.",
