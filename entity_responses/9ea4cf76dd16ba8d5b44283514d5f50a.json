  "response": "**1. Purpose of this structure:**\n\nThe `_HALCOSA_DML_ETH_PORT_SINFO` structure represents information about an Ethernet port on a device.\n\n**2. Key fields and their significance:**\n\n- `Name`: The name of the Ethernet port.\n- `bUpstream`: Indicates whether the port is an upstream or downstream port.\n- `MacAddress`: The MAC address of the port.\n\n**3. Usage context in RDK:**\n\nThis structure is used by the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) component in RDK to provide information about Ethernet ports on the device. It is used by other components, such as the DML (Data Model Layer), to manage and configure Ethernet ports.\n\n**4. Related components or interfaces:**\n\n- HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)\n- DML (Data Model Layer)\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related details:**\n\nThis structure is specific to RDK and is not used in other contexts.",
