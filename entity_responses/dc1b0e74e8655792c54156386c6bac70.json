  "response": "**Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe wifi_setFTMobilityDomainID() function is used to set the Fast Transition (FT) Mobility Domain ID for a specific Access Point (AP). FT is a mechanism that allows mobile devices to roam between APs without having to re-authenticate with the network. The Mobility Domain ID is a 16-bit value that identifies the network that the AP belongs to.\n\n**Key operations and data flow:**\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n* `apIndex` - The index of the AP that the setting applies to.\n* `mobilityDomain` - The Mobility Domain ID to set.\n\nThe function sets the Mobility Domain ID for the specified AP. This ID is used by mobile devices to determine which network the AP belongs to.\n\n**Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThe function interacts with the following components:\n\n* The Wi-Fi driver\n* The Wi-Fi stack\n\n**Important parameters and return values:**\n\nThe following parameters are important to note:\n\n* `apIndex` - The index of the AP that the setting applies to. This parameter must be a valid AP index.\n* `mobilityDomain` - The Mobility Domain ID to set. This parameter must be a valid Mobility Domain ID.\n\nThe function returns the following values:\n\n* `RETURN_OK` - The function was successful.\n* `RETURN_ERR` - The function failed.\n\n**Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThe function is not specific to RDK. It is a generic function that can be used by any application that needs to set the FT Mobility Domain ID for an AP.",
