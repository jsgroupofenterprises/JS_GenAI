  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nCosaDmlWiFi_GetHS2Stats is a function in the CcspWifiAgent component that retrieves Hotspot 2.0 (HS2) statistics for a specific access point (AP). HS2 is a set of Wi-Fi Alliance specifications that define a standardized way for devices to connect to public Wi-Fi networks using a seamless and secure onboarding process.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n* The function takes a PCOSA_DML_WIFI_AP_CFG struct as input, which contains configuration information for the AP.\n* It checks if the AP context is valid and that the AP instance number is within the valid range.\n* It retrieves HS2 statistics from the g_interworking_data[] array, which is a global array that stores interworking data for each AP.\n* It parses the HS2 statistics in JSON format and extracts relevant information, such as EAPOL start success/failure counts, ANQP response counts, and realm/domain/GPP request/failure counts.\n* It sets the corresponding fields in the PCOSA_DML_WIFI_AP_CFG struct with the extracted HS2 statistics.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe function does not explicitly interact with other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n- **pCfg**: Pointer to the PCOSA_DML_WIFI_AP_CFG struct that will store the HS2 statistics.\n- **Return value**: void\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
