  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `wifi_getApAssociatedDevicesHighWatermarkThresholdReached` function gets the maximum number of associated devices that have ever associated with the access point concurrently since the last reset of the device or WiFi module.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n* `apIndex`: The index of the access point.\n* `output`: A pointer to the variable where the maximum number of associated devices will be stored.\n\nThe function first checks if the input parameters are valid. If they are not, the function returns an error. Otherwise, the function gets the maximum number of associated devices from the access point. The function then stores the maximum number of associated devices in the variable that was passed in as the `output` parameter.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `wifi_getApAssociatedDevicesHighWatermarkThresholdReached` function interacts with the following components:\n\n* The access point driver. The function gets the maximum number of associated devices from the access point driver.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* `apIndex`: The index of the access point.\n* `output`: A pointer to the variable where the maximum number of associated devices will be stored.\n* The function returns the following values:\n    * `RETURN_OK` if the function was successful.\n    * `RETURN_ERR` if the function failed.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `wifi_getApAssociatedDevicesHighWatermarkThresholdReached` function is not specific to RDK. It can be used in any application that needs to get the maximum number of associated devices for an access point.",
