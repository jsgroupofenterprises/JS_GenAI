  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `CosaWifiRemove` function is responsible for removing a Wi-Fi object from the system. This includes removing all the associated SSIDs, Access Points, and other resources.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function first checks if the Wi-Fi object is valid.\nIf it is, it removes all the associated SSIDs and Access Points by iterating through the `SsidQueue` and `AccessPointQueue` and freeing the memory used by each entry.\nIt then removes the Band Steering object and ATM object and finally frees the memory used by the Wi-Fi object itself.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `CosaWifiRemove` function does not interact with any other components directly.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe `CosaWifiRemove` function takes a single parameter:\n\n- `hThisObject`: The handle to the Wi-Fi object to be removed.\n\nThe function returns an `ANSC_STATUS` value indicating the success or failure of the operation.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `CosaWifiRemove` function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations.",
