  "response": "**1. Purpose**\n\nThe `ethernet_port_details` structure represents detailed information about an Ethernet port on a device.\n\n**2. Key Fields**\n\n* **Name:** A 64-character string that identifies the Ethernet port. This name is typically assigned by the system firmware.\n* **Mac:** A 6-byte array that contains the Media Access Control (MAC) address of the Ethernet port. The MAC address is a unique identifier for the port on the network.\n\n**3. Usage Context in RDK**\n\nThe `ethernet_port_details` structure is used in various RDK components and interfaces to provide information about Ethernet ports on the device. For example, the `hal_getPortDetails` function in the `hal` component returns an array of `ethernet_port_details` structures, one for each Ethernet port on the device.\n\n**4. Related Components or Interfaces**\n\n* `hal`: The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) component provides access to the hardware resources on the device. The `hal_getPortDetails` function in the `hal` component returns an array of `ethernet_port_details` structures.\n* Network Management Interfaces: RDK provides a set of network management interfaces that can be used to manage the Ethernet ports on the device. These interfaces allow you to perform operations such as configuring the IP address, subnet mask, and gateway address for each port.\n\n**5. RDK-Specific Details**\n\nThe `ethernet_port_details` structure is defined in the `rdk_types.h` header file. This header file is included in all RDK components and interfaces that use the `ethernet_port_details` structure.",
