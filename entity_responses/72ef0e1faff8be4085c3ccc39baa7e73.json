  "response": "## **1. Main Purpose and Functionality**\n\n- The `events_CSItable_removerowhandler` function removes a row from the CSI table based on a given `rowName`.\n\n## **2. Key Operations and Data Flow**\n\n- The function first acquires a lock on the `g_events_lock` mutex to protect the shared data structures.\n- It then iterates through the CSI event queue, searching for an event with a matching `name`.\n- If found, the event is removed from the queue.\n- The function then iterates through the CSI queue, searching for an entry with a matching `csi_session_num` to the removed event's `idx`.\n- If found, the CSI entry is removed from the queue and freed.\n- The removed event is also freed.\n- The `csi_del_session` function is then called to delete the corresponding CSI session.\n\n## **3. Interaction with Other Components**\n\n- The function interacts with the following components:\n  - The CSI event queue\n  - The CSI queue\n  - The `csi_del_session` function\n\n## **4. Important Parameters and Return Values**\n\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `handle`: RBUS handle\n  - `rowName`: Name of the row to remove\n- **Return values**:\n  - `RBUS_ERROR_SUCCESS` on success\n  - `RBUS_ERROR_BUS_ERROR` if the CSI queue is NULL or the event or CSI entry could not be found\n\n## **5. Any Specific RDK-Related Operations**\n\n- The function uses the `get_csi_entry_queue` function to retrieve the pointer to the CSI queue, which is a RDK-specific data structure.",
