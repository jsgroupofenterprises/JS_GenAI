  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\nThe `wifi_setBandSteeringBandUtilizationThreshold` function sets the band steering band utilization threshold.\nThis threshold is used to determine when to steer clients from one band to another.\nFor example, if the threshold is set to 60%, then when the utilization of one band exceeds 60%, clients will be steered to the other band.\nThis helps to balance the load between the two bands and improve overall performance.\n\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\nThe `wifi_setBandSteeringBandUtilizationThreshold` function takes two parameters:\n- `radioIndex`: The index of the radio to set the threshold for.\n- `buThreshold`: The band utilization threshold.\n\nThe function first checks if the radio index is valid.\nIf it is not, the function returns an error.\nOtherwise, the function sets the threshold and returns success.\n\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\nThe `wifi_setBandSteeringBandUtilizationThreshold` function interacts with the following components:\n- The Wi-Fi driver\n- The band steering algorithm\n\nThe Wi-Fi driver is responsible for setting the threshold on the hardware.\nThe band steering algorithm uses the threshold to determine when to steer clients.\n\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\nThe following parameters are important to understand when using the `wifi_setBandSteeringBandUtilizationThreshold` function:\n- `radioIndex`: The index of the radio to set the threshold for.\n- `buThreshold`: The band utilization threshold.\n\nThe function returns the following values:\n- RETURN_OK: The function was successful.\n- RETURN_ERR: The function failed.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\nThe `wifi_setBandSteeringBandUtilizationThreshold` function is not specific to RDK.\nIt is a general-purpose function that can be used with any Wi-Fi driver that supports band steering.",
