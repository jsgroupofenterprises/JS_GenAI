  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**:\n   - The `ovsdb_cache_update_cb` function is a callback function that is invoked when there is an update to the OVSDB cache.\n   - It handles the insertion, modification, and deletion of rows in the cache based on the type of update that has been received.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n   - The function takes as input an `ovsdb_update_monitor_t` object, which contains information about the update, including the table name, the UUID of the row that has been updated, and the JSON data representing the new values of the row.\n   - The function first checks the integrity of the table and the row, and then performs the appropriate action based on the type of update.\n   - If the update is a new row, it creates a new row object and inserts it into the cache. If the update is a modification to an existing row, it updates the row object in the cache. If the update is a deletion, it removes the row object from the cache.\n   - After the update has been performed, the function calls the cache callback function, if one has been defined for the table, to notify other components of the change.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**:\n   - The `ovsdb_cache_update_cb` function interacts with the following components:\n      - The OVSDB cache: The function updates the cache based on the update information that it receives.\n      - The cache callback function: The function calls the cache callback function, if one has been defined for the table, to notify other components of the change.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n   - The `ovsdb_update_monitor_t` object: This object contains information about the update, including the table name, the UUID of the row that has been updated, and the JSON data representing the new values of the row.\n   - The return type of the function is void.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**:\n   - The `ovsdb_cache_update_cb` function is used by the CcspWifiAgent component of RDK to manage the OVSDB cache.",
