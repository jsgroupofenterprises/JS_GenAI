  "response": "**1. Main Purpose and Functionality**\n\nThe `queue_destroy` function in CcspWifiAgent is responsible for destroying a queue data structure, freeing all memory allocated for the queue and its elements.\n\n**2. Key Operations and Data Flow**\n\n- The function iterates through the linked list of elements in the queue, using a `while` loop.\n- For each element, it frees the memory allocated for the element's data and the element itself.\n- After freeing all elements, the memory allocated for the queue structure is also freed.\n\n**3. Interaction with Other Components (if any)**\n\nThis function is typically used by components that use queues for data management or communication. It does not interact with other specific components directly.\n\n**4. Important Parameters and Return Values**\n\n- `queue_t *q`: A pointer to the queue to be destroyed.\n- The function does not return any value (void).\n\n**5. Any Specific RDK-related Operations**\n\nThis function does not perform any RDK-specific operations. It is a generic utility function for managing queues.",
