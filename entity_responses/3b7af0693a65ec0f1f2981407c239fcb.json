  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe Wifi Direct Protected Setup (DPP) feature enables secure and easy pairing between Wi-Fi devices. It uses public key cryptography to establish a secure connection between two devices without the need for a password.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n1. The initiator device generates a random number and sends it to the responder device.\n2. The responder device generates a random number and sends it to the initiator device.\n3. The initiator device uses the random number from the responder device to generate a shared secret key.\n4. The responder device uses the random number from the initiator device to generate the same shared secret key.\n5. The initiator device encrypts a message using the shared secret key and sends it to the responder device.\n6. The responder device decrypts the message using the shared secret key and sends a response back to the initiator device.\n7. The initiator device verifies the response from the responder device and if it is correct, the two devices are now securely paired.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nDPP interacts with the Wi-Fi driver to send and receive DPP messages. It also interacts with the Wi-Fi configuration manager to store and manage DPP credentials.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* **Initiator device:** The device that starts the DPP process.\n* **Responder device:** The device that responds to the DPP request.\n* **Random number:** A random number that is used to generate the shared secret key.\n* **Shared secret key:** A key that is used to encrypt and decrypt DPP messages.\n* **Encrypted message:** A message that is encrypted using the shared secret key.\n* **Response:** A message that is sent back to the initiator device after the encrypted message has been decrypted.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nDPP is supported in RDK-B starting with version 12.0.",
