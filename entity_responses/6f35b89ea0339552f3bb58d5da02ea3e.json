  "response": "The intent of **wifi_getApDASRadiusServer**  function in RDK is to extract the IP Address and port number of the RADIUS DAS server that is used in WLAN security for a specific Access Point. Device.Wifi.AccessPoint.{i}.Security.RADIUSDASServerIPAddress and Device.Wifi.AccessPoint.{i}.Security.RADIUSDASServerPort will be output with the IP Address and the port number respectively. It is applicable only when ModeEnabled is set as an Enterprise type (WPA-Enterprise, WPA2-Enterprise, or WPA-WPA2-Enterprise). \n\n**Key operations and data flow:**\n\n1. The function takes three arguments:  apIndex (the index of the Access Point), IP_output (an output buffer for the IP Address), and Port_output (an output buffer for the port number).\n2. It internally accesses the Device.Wifi.AccessPoint.{i}.Security.RADIUSDASServerIPAddress and Device.Wifi.AccessPoint.{i}.Security.RADIUSDASServerPort  and writes the values to the output buffers.\n\n**Interaction with other components:**\n\nThis function interacts with the driver to retrieve the RADIUS DAS server's IP Address and port number.\n\n**Important parameters and return values:**\n\n* **apIndex:** The index of the Access Point.\n* **IP_output:** An output buffer for the IP Address.\n* **Port_output:** An output buffer for the port number.\n* **RETURN_OK:** The operation was successful.\n* **RETURN_ERR:** The operation failed.\n\n**Specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThis function is part of the RDK Wi-Fi HAL API and is used by RDK applications to manage Wi-Fi settings.",
