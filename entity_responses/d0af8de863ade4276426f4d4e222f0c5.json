  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `pjs_ovs_set_string_from_json` function in the CcspWifiAgent component of the RDK parses a JSON object and extracts a string value from it, storing the result in an output buffer.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n- The function takes as input a JSON object, a name for the value to be extracted, an output buffer, and the size of the buffer.\n- It parses the JSON object and searches for the specified name.\n- If the name is found, the corresponding value is extracted and stored in the output buffer.\n- The number of values extracted is stored in an output variable, and a flag indicating whether the value was found is set.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThis function does not interact with any other components directly.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n- `out`: The output buffer where the extracted string will be stored.\n- `out_sz`: The size of the output buffer.\n- `out_max`: The maximum number of values to extract.\n- `out_num`: A pointer to a variable where the number of extracted values will be stored.\n- `present`: A pointer to a variable where a flag indicating whether the value was found will be stored.\n- `js`: The JSON object to be parsed.\n- `name`: The name of the value to be extracted.\n- `update`: A flag indicating whether to update the value in the output buffer if it already exists.\n- `err`: A pointer to a variable where any error messages will be stored.\n\n**5.
