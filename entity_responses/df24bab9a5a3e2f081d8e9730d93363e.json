  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `qm_conn_send_custom` function is used to send a custom message to a QNETM server. \nIt takes various parameters, including the data type, compression method, flags, topic, data, data size, and a response object.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function initializes a `qm_request_t` structure called `req` and sets its `cmd` field to `QM_CMD_SEND`.\n It then sets the `data_type`, `compress`, and `flags` fields of the `req` structure based on the input parameters.\nFinally, it calls the `qm_conn_send_req` function to send the message and waits for a response.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `qm_conn_send_custom` function interacts with the QM daemon, which is responsible for sending messages to and receiving messages from QNETM servers.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe important parameters of the `qm_conn_send_custom` function are:\n\n* `data_type`: The type of data being sent.\n* `compress`: The compression method to use.\n* `flags`: Flags to control the behavior of the message.\n* `topic`: The topic of the message.\n* `data`: The data to be sent.\n* `data_size`: The size of the data.\n* `res`: A response object to receive the response from the server.\n\nThe function returns `true` if the message was sent successfully, and `false` otherwise.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `qm_conn_send_custom` function is part of the RDK QNETM Agent, which is used to manage and interact with QNETM servers.",
