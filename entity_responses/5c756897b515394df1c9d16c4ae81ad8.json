  "response": "### 1. Main purpose and functionality\n   \n   The `wifi_getApMacAddressControlMode` function is used to get the MAC address control mode for a specific access point. \n   The MAC address control mode determines how the access point handles MAC addresses of associated devices.\n   There are two possible MAC address control modes:\n   * **Allow all**: All devices are allowed to connect to the access point, regardless of their MAC address.\n   * **Deny all**:  No devices are allowed to connect to the access point, regardless of their MAC address.\n\n### 2. Key operations and data flow\n\nThe key operations and data flow of the `wifi_getApMacAddressControlMode` function are as follows:\n\n1. The function takes two parameters:\n   * `apIndex`: The index of the access point for which to get the MAC address control mode.\n   * `output_filterMode`: A pointer to a variable in which to store the MAC address control mode.\n2. The function gets the MAC address control mode for the specified access point from the underlying hardware.\n3. The function stores the MAC address control mode in the variable pointed to by `output_filterMode`.\n4. The function returns RETURN_OK if successful, or RETURN_ERR if an error occurs.\n\n### 3. Interaction with other components (if any)\n\nThe `wifi_getApMacAddressControlMode` function interacts with the underlying hardware to get the MAC address control mode for the specified access point.\n\n### 4. Important parameters and return values\n\nThe important parameters and return values of the `wifi_getApMacAddressControlMode` function are as follows:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n|---|---|\n| `apIndex` | The index of the access point for which to get the MAC address control mode. |\n| `output_filterMode` | A pointer to a variable in which to store the MAC address control mode. |\n| Return value | The status of the operation. RETURN_OK if successful, or RETURN_ERR if an error occurs. |\n\n### 5. Any specific RDK-related operations\n\nThe `wifi_getApMacAddressControlMode` function is not specific to RDK. It can be used in any application that needs to get the MAC address control mode for a Wi-Fi access point.",
