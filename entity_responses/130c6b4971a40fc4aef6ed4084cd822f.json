  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `hapd_reload_radius_server_secret` function updates the RADIUS server shared secret in the hostapd configuration. This is used to secure communication between the hostapd and RADIUS server for user authentication and authorization.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n* The function takes as input a pointer to the hostapd data, a pointer to the BSS configuration, the new RADIUS server shared secret, and a flag indicating whether this is for the primary or secondary RADIUS server.\n* If the flag is set to true, the function updates the shared secret for the primary RADIUS server. \n* Otherwise, it updates the shared secret for the secondary RADIUS server.\n* The function first frees any existing shared secret and then allocates a new buffer for the new shared secret.\n* Finally, it copies the new shared secret into the buffer and updates the shared secret length field.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `hapd_reload_radius_server_secret` function interacts with the hostapd daemon to update the RADIUS server shared secret.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* `hapd`: pointer to the hostapd data\n* `conf`: pointer to the BSS configuration\n* `radiusSecret`: the new RADIUS server shared secret\n* `isPrimary`: flag indicating whether this is for the primary or secondary RADIUS server\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThis function is specific to the RDK as it is used to update the RADIUS server shared secret in the hostapd configuration.",
