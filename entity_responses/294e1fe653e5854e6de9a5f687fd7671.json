  "response": "## Analysis of eapol_frame_received() Function\n\n### 1. Main purpose and functionality\n\nThe `eapol_frame_received()` function in CcspWifiAgent is a callback function registered to receive EAPOL frames from the Wi-Fi driver. It is responsible for processing incoming EAPOL frames and taking appropriate actions based on the frame type and data.\n\n### 2. Key operations and data flow\n\nWhen an EAPOL frame is received, the Wi-Fi driver invokes the `eapol_frame_received()` function, passing the following parameters:\n\n- `ap_index`: Index of the access point (AP) that received the frame.\n- `sta`: MAC address of the station (STA) that sent the frame.\n- `type`: Type of EAPOL frame (e.g., EAPOL-Start, EAPOL-Key).\n- `data`: Pointer to the EAPOL frame data.\n- `len`: Length of the EAPOL frame data.\n\nThe function analyzes the type of EAPOL frame and performs the following actions:\n\n- For EAPOL-Start frames, it initiates the EAPOL handshake process.\n- For EAPOL-Key frames, it processes the key material and updates the STA's security association.\n- For other EAPOL frame types, it forwards the frame to the EAPOL state machine for further processing.\n\n### 3. Interaction with other components (if any)\n\nThe `eapol_frame_received()` function interacts with the following components:\n\n- **Wi-Fi driver:** Receives EAPOL frames from the driver and invokes the callback function to process them.\n- **EAPOL state machine:** Forwards EAPOL frames to the state machine for further processing.\n- **Security module:** Assists in processing EAPOL-Key frames and updating security associations.\n\n### 4. Important parameters and return values\n\nThe following parameters are important for the function:\n\n- **ap_index:** Identifies the AP that received the frame.\n- **sta:** Identifies the STA that sent the frame.\n- **type:** Indicates the type of EAPOL frame.\n- **data:** Contains the EAPOL frame data.\n- **len:** Specifies the length of the EAPOL frame data.\n\nThe function has no explicit return value.\n\n### 5. Any specific RDK-related operations\n\nThe `eapol_frame_received()` function is part of the RDK Wi-Fi Agent and is used to process EAPOL frames in an RDK-based home gateway. It enables secure wireless communication between devices and the gateway.",
