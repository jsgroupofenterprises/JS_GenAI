  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n>The voice_hal_getLoggingLevel function is designed to retrieve the current logging level for a specified voice service. The logging level indicates the verbosity of logging messages generated by the voice service, providing control over the amount of detailed information recorded.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n> - The function takes two parameters:\n    - service: The index of the voice service for which the logging level needs to be retrieved.\n    - pLevel: A pointer to a uint32_t variable where the retrieved logging level will be stored.\n> - The function first validates the input parameters to ensure that they are valid.\n> - It then retrieves the logging level for the specified voice service from the internal configuration or system settings.\n> - The function stores the retrieved logging level in the memory location pointed to by pLevel.\n> - If successful, the function returns RDK_SUCCESS; otherwise, it returns RDK_FAILURE to indicate an error.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n>This function primarily interacts with the underlying voice service implementation. It retrieves the logging level setting from the voice service's configuration or internal state.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n> - **service**: The index of the voice service for which the logging level is to be retrieved.\n> - **pLevel**: A pointer to a uint32_t variable where the retrieved logging level will be stored.\n> - **Return value**: The function returns RDK_SUCCESS upon success or RDK_FAILURE if an error occurs.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n>The function is a part of the RDK HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) for voice services. It provides a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the logging level of voice services in an RDK environment. The function simplifies the process of managing logging levels for voice services by providing a consistent API across different implementations.",
