  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**:\n   - The `mon_check_counter` function is responsible for monitoring counters from processes that are expected to increment regularly.\n   - If a counter doesn't increment within a specified time period (MON_COUNTER_MAX), it logs an error, indicating that the counter is frozen.\n   - The function then attempts to abort the process or thread associated with the frozen counter.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n   - The function iterates through a list of counters (`mon_counter_list`) and checks if each counter has been updated since the last check.\n   - If a counter has not been updated, it calculates the time since the last update and compares it to the maximum allowed time (MON_COUNTER_MAX).\n   - If the time since the last update exceeds the maximum, it logs an error and attempts to abort the associated process or thread.\n   - The function returns true if no frozen counters are found and false otherwise.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components**:\n   - The function uses the `LOG` macro to log errors and information messages.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n   - **`child`**: The process ID of the process to monitor.\n   - **`exit_status`**: A pointer to an integer that will receive the exit status of the aborted process or thread.\n   - **Returns**: True if no frozen counters are found, false otherwise.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**:\n   - The function uses the `TICKS_S` macro to convert seconds to ticks, which is a measure of time used by RDK.",
