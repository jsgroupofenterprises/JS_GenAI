  "response": "1. Main purpose and functionality:\n    This function aims to set the URI by which the user agent will identify itself for a specific line. \n    It takes the input parameters service, profile, line, and buffer, where service represents the voice service, \n    profile represents the voice profile, line represents the ATA line number, and buffer holds the new URI as a null-terminated string. \n    If the buffer provided is empty, the actual URI used in the SIP signaling will be automatically formed by the CPE as \"sip:UserName@Domain\", \n    where UserName is the username given for this line in AuthUserName, and Domain is the domain given for this profile in VoiceProfile.{i}. \n    \n2. Key operations and data flow:\n   - Retrieve the service, profile, line, and buffer input parameters.\n   - Check if the buffer provided is empty.\n   - If the buffer is empty, the actual URI used in SIP signaling is automatically formed as \"sip:UserName@Domain\".\n   - Otherwise, set the URI by which the user agent will identify itself for this line.\n   - Return the status of the operation.\n   \n3. Interaction with other components (if any):\n   - This function interacts with the SIP stack to set the URI by which the user agent identifies itself for this line.\n\n4. Important parameters and return values:\n   - service: The voice service affected.\n   - profile: The voice profile affected.\n   - line: The ATA line number affected.\n   - buffer: A buffer holding the new URI as a null-terminated string.\n   - Return value: The status of the operation.\n   \n5. Any specific RDK-related operations:\n   - This function is part of the RDK Voice HAL API and is used by RDK-based CPEs to configure voice-related settings.",
