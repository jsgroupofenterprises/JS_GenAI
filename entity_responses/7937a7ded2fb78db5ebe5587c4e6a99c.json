  "response": "**1. Purpose**\nThe `moca_flow_table_t` structure represents a MoCA interface flow statistics table, providing information about incoming priority-based QoS (PQoS) flows on the MoCA interface. It tracks statistics for each flow, including flow ID, ingress and egress node IDs, lease time left, and various rate-related parameters.\n\n**2. Key Fields**\n- `FlowID`: Unique ID of the PQoS flow\n- `IngressNodeID`: ID of the node where the PQoS flow originates (ingress node)\n- `EgressNodeID`: ID of the destination node for the PQoS flow (egress node)\n- `FlowTimeLeft`: Remaining lease time for the PQoS flow\n- `DestinationMACAddress`: Destination MAC address of Ethernet packets for the PQoS flow at the ingress node\n- `PacketSize`: Number of MoCA aggregation frames in the PQoS flow\n- `PeakDataRate`: Peak data rate for the PQoS flow\n- `BurstSize`: Burst size for the PQoS flow\n- `FlowTag`: Application-specific content associated with the PQoS flow\n- `LeaseTime`: Lease time for the PQoS flow\n\n**3. Usage Context**\nThe `moca_flow_table_t` structure is primarily used by RDK software components that are responsible for managing MoCA interfaces and monitoring the characteristics of PQoS flows.\n\n**4. Related Components**\n- MoCA Device Driver\n- MoCA Interface Controller\n\n**5. RDK-Specific Details**\n- The `moca_flow_table_t` structure is part of the RDK HAL framework, which provides a common programming interface for various device components.\n- The structure is defined in the `moca_interface.h` header file in RDK.\n- The structure is used by the RDK MoCA API functions that allow developers to query and manage PQoS flows on the MoCA interface.",
