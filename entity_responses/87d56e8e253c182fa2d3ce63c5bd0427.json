  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**: This function is used to push interworking elements into an access point's (AP's) beacon frames. Interworking elements (IEs) are used to provide additional information to wireless devices that are attempting to connect to the AP.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**: The function takes two parameters: an AP index and a pointer to a `wifi_InterworkingElement_t` structure. The `wifi_InterworkingElement_t` structure contains the IE's ID, length, and data. The function will add the IE to the AP's beacon frames.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**: This function does not interact directly with any other components. However, the IEs that are pushed into the AP's beacon frames will be used by wireless devices that are attempting to connect to the AP.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n    * `apIndex`: The index of the AP that the IE should be pushed into.\n    * `infoElement`: A pointer to a `wifi_InterworkingElement_t` structure that contains the IE's ID, length, and data.\n    * Return value: The function returns `INT` value which indicates the status of the operation.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**: This function is part of the RDK HAL API and is used to configure Wi-Fi APs.",
