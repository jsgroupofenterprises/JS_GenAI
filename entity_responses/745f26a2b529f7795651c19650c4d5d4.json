  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**:\n   - The `schema2tree` function takes a series of key-value pairs and constructs a tree structure from them.\n   - The tree is a binary search tree, where each node contains a key and a value.\n   - The function returns a pointer to the root of the tree.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n   - The function first allocates memory for the tree and initializes it.\n   - Then, it iterates through the key-value pairs, creating a new node for each pair and inserting it into the tree.\n   - The function uses the `str_tree_cmp` function to compare keys when inserting nodes into the tree.\n   - The function also uses the `get_pair` function to get a pointer to the node that contains the specified key.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**:\n   - The function interacts with the `ds_tree` component, which provides the data structures and algorithms for the tree.\n   - The function also interacts with the `str_tree_cmp` and `get_pair` functions, which are used to compare keys and get nodes from the tree.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n   - The `key_size` and `value_size` parameters specify the size of the keys and values in the key-value pairs.\n   - The `nelems` parameter specifies the number of key-value pairs in the array.\n   - The `keys` and `values` parameters are arrays of keys and values, respectively.\n   - The return value is a pointer to the root of the tree.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**:\n   - The function is not specific to RDK, but it is used in several RDK components to create trees from configuration data.",
