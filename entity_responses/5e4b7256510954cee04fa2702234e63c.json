  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe purpose of `deinit_eloop` function in CcspWifiAgent is to deinitialize the event loop (`eloop`) and perform cleanup operations related to logging and other resources.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\n* Checks if the event loop has been initialized (`is_eloop_init_done`).\n* If the event loop has been initialized:\n  * Terminates the event loop (`eloop_terminate`).\n  * Destroys the event loop (`eloop_destroy`).\n  * Updates the `is_eloop_init_done` flag to indicate that the event loop has been deinitialized.\n  * Logs a debug message indicating that the event loop has been deinitialized.\n* Unlinks the `/var/run/hostapd` socket file (optional, based on build configuration).\n* Closes debug logging files.\n* Deinitializes the Wi-Fi callback mechanism (optional, based on product requirements).\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\n* The Wi-Fi callback mechanism (if enabled).\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe function takes no parameters and has no return value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\n* The function is a part of the RDK CcspWifiAgent component.\n* It uses the `wpa_printf` logging function from the RDK Wi-Fi wrapper.",
