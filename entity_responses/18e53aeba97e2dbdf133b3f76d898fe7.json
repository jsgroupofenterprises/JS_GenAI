  "response": "## Analysis of termSignalHandler function\n\n### 1. Main purpose and functionality\n\nThe `termSignalHandler` function is a signal handler that is called when a specific signal (e.g., SIGINT, SIGTERM) is received by the program.\nIts main purpose is to perform cleanup operations and exit the program gracefully when a termination signal is received.\n\n### 2. Key operations and data flow\n\n* **Unsubscribe from RBUS events:** The function iterates through all the RBUS subscriptions and unsubscribes from them.\n* **Release RBUS handle:** It closes the RBUS handle, releasing any resources associated with it.\n* **Remove CSI events table:** It checks if there are no more events left and if the CSI event set is set. If so, it removes the CSI events table.\n* **Close file pointer:** If a file pointer is open, it is closed.\n* **Exit program:** The function exits the program with a status code of 0.\n\n### 3. Interaction with other components (if any)\n\nThe function interacts with the RBUS component to unsubscribe from events and close the RBUS handle.\nIt also interacts with the file system to close a file pointer if necessary.\n\n### 4. Important parameters and return values\n\n* **int sig:** This parameter contains the signal number that triggered the function call.\n* **The function has no return value.**\n\n### 5. Any specific RDK-related operations\n\nThe function uses the RDK-specific RBUS library to unsubscribe from events and close the RBUS handle.\nIt also interacts with the RDK-specific CSI events table.",
