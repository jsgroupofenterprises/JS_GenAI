  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality**:\n   - The _c_get_data_by_key function in CcspWifiAgent is used to retrieve the data associated with a specific key from a list of items.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow**:\n   - The function takes three parameters:\n     - A pointer to an array of c_item_t structs representing the list of items.\n     - The size of the list.\n     - The key to search for.\n   - It first calls the _c_get_item_by_key function to find the item in the list that matches the specified key.\n   - If an item with the specified key is found, the function returns the pointer to the data in the item.\n   - If no item is found, the function returns -1.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components**:\n   - The _c_get_data_by_key function does not directly interact with any other components.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n   - The most important parameter is the key, which is used to search for the item in the list.\n   - The return value is a pointer to the data in the item, or -1 if no item is found.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**:\n   - The _c_get_data_by_key function is not specific to RDK and can be used in any C program.",
