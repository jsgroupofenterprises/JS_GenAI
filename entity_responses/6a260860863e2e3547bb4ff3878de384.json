  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `wifi_add_mac_handler` function adds a MAC address to the greylist of a hostapd instance. The greylist is used to track MAC addresses that have been detected as being associated with malicious activity.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe `wifi_add_mac_handler` function takes two arguments:\n\n* `addr`: The MAC address to be added to the greylist.\n* `hapd`: A pointer to the hostapd data structure.\n\nThe function first checks if the MAC address is already in the greylist. If it is, the function does nothing. If the MAC address is not in the greylist, the function adds it to the greylist and starts a 24-hour timer. If the MAC address is not removed from the greylist within 24 hours, the MAC address will be blocked from accessing the network.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `wifi_add_mac_handler` function interacts with the following components:\n\n* The hostapd daemon: The `wifi_add_mac_handler` function adds the MAC address to the hostapd greylist.\n* The eloop event loop: The `wifi_add_mac_handler` function starts a 24-hour timer using the eloop event loop.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe `wifi_add_mac_handler` function has no return value. The function takes two parameters:\n\n* `addr`: The MAC address to be added to the greylist.\n* `hapd`: A pointer to the hostapd data structure.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `wifi_add_mac_handler` function is used to implement the RDKB-30263 Grey List control from RADIUS feature. This feature allows RADIUS servers to add MAC addresses to the greylist of a hostapd instance.",
