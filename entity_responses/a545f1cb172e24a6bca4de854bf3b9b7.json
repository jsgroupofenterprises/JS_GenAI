  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `print_plan_id` function in the CcspWifiAgent component of RDK is responsible for converting an unsigned char array `plan` representing a plan ID into a human-readable string and storing it in the buffer pointed to by `key`.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n* The function takes two parameters: `plan`, an unsigned char array containing the plan ID, and `key`, an unsigned char array where the converted string should be stored.\n* It iterates through the `plan` array, converting each byte to a hexadecimal string using `snprintf`.\n* The resulting hexadecimal strings are concatenated and stored in the `key` buffer.\n* The function does not return any value but modifies the `key` buffer in place.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThe function operates independently without interacting with any other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n* **`plan`:** The input plan ID as an unsigned char array.\n* **`key`:** The output buffer where the converted string will be stored.\n* The function does not return any value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThe function uses constants defined in the RDK header files, specifically `PLAN_ID_LENGTH` and `PLAN_ID_LEN`.",
