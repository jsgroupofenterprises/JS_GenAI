  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe ovsdb_tran_delete_with_parent function is used to delete one or more rows from an OVSDB table, and simultaneously update the parent table to remove references to the deleted rows.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\na) The function takes as input the OVSDB socket path, the table name, a list of UUIDs to delete, the parent table name, a where clause for the parent table, and the column in the parent table that stores the UUIDs.\n\nb) It creates a sub-transaction for each UUID to be deleted. Each sub-transaction contains a where clause that matches the UUID and a delete operation.\n\nc) It creates a final sub-transaction that updates the parent table to remove the UUIDs. This sub-transaction contains a where clause that matches the parent table's where clause, and a mutation that sets the column in the parent table that stores the UUIDs to an empty set.\n\nd) It combines all the sub-transactions into a single transaction and returns the transaction object.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\n\nThe function interacts with the OVSDB server to perform the delete and update operations.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n**Parameters:**\n\na) ovsdb_sock_path: The path to the OVSDB socket.\nb) table: The name of the table to delete from.\nc) uuids: A list of UUIDs to delete.\nd) parent_table: The name of the parent table.\ne) parent_where: A where clause for the parent table.\nf) parent_column: The column in the parent table that stores the UUIDs.\n\n**Return value:**\n\nThe function returns a transaction object that can be used to commit the delete and update operations to the OVSDB server.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThe function is used to delete and update data in OVSDB tables, which is a common operation in RDK applications.**",
