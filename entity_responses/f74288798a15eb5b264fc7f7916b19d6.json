  "response": "## Overview\n\n1. **Main purpose and functionality**: The `wifi_getBSSColorEnabled` function in the RDK hal component is used to retrieve the BSS Color value for a given access point.\n2. **Key operations and data flow**: The function takes two parameters: an integer specifying the access point index, and a pointer to a boolean variable where the BSS Color value will be stored. The function queries the hardware to obtain the BSS Color value for the specified access point and returns it through the provided pointer.\n3. **Interaction with other components (if any)**: It is likely that this function interacts with the Wi-Fi driver and/or firmware to retrieve the BSS Color value from the hardware.\n4. **Important parameters and return values**:\n   - **apIndex**: The index of the access point for which the BSS Color value is to be retrieved.\n   - **enabled**: A pointer to a boolean variable where the BSS Color value will be stored. The function returns INT representing the status of the operation:\n     - RETURN_OK: If the operation was successful.\n     - RETURN_ERR: If there was an error in retrieving the BSS Color value.\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations**: This function is part of the RDK HAL API, which provides a standardized interface for interacting with Wi-Fi hardware on RDK-based devices.",
