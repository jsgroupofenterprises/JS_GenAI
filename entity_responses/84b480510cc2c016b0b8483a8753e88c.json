  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\n\nThe `ovsdb_table_delete_where_with_parent` function in `CcspWifiAgent` deletes rows from an Open vSwitch Database (OVSDB) table based on a specified condition and a parent table with a specified column. It performs a synchronous delete operation to ensure that the changes are committed to the database before returning.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n\n* The function takes several parameters, including the OVSDB socket path, the OVSDB table to delete from, a JSON object representing the condition for deletion, a parent table name, a JSON object representing the condition for the parent table, and the name of the column in the parent table to match.\n* It calls the `ovsdb_sync_delete_with_parent` helper function, which constructs an OVSDB request message and sends it to the specified OVSDB socket.\n* The request message includes the table name, the delete condition, the parent table name, the parent condition, and the parent column name.\n* The OVSDB server processes the request and deletes the matching rows from the specified table.\n* The function returns an integer indicating the status of the delete operation (0 for success, -1 for failure).\n\n**3. Interaction with other components:**\n\nThe function interacts with the OVSDB server to perform the delete operation.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n\n* **ovsdb_sock_path:** The socket path to the OVSDB server.\n* **table:** The OVSDB table to delete from.\n* **where:** A JSON object representing the condition for deletion.\n* **parent_table:** The name of the parent table.\n* **parent_where:** A JSON object representing the condition for the parent table.\n* **parent_column:** The name of the column in the parent table to match.\n* **Return value:** An integer indicating the status of the delete operation (0 for success, -1 for failure).\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n\nThe function does not perform any specific RDK-related operations. It is a general-purpose function for deleting rows from an OVSDB table based on a specified condition and a parent table with a specified column.",
