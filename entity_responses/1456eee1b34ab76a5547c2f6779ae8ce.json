  "response": "## wifi_getApMaxAssociatedDevices Function\n\n### Main Purpose and Functionality\n\nThe `wifi_getApMaxAssociatedDevices` function retrieves the maximum number of devices that can simultaneously connect to an access point (AP).\n\n### Key Operations and Data Flow\n\nThe RDK function `wifi_getApMaxAssociatedDevices` performs the following key operations:\n\n1. It takes two parameters:\n   - `apIndex`: The index of the AP whose maximum associated devices count is to be retrieved.\n   - `output`: A pointer to a variable where the maximum associated devices count will be stored.\n\n2. The function retrieves the maximum associated devices count from the AP configuration.\n\n3. It stores the count in the `output` variable.\n\n### Interaction with Other Components\n\nThis function interacts with the following components:\n\n- The AP driver, which provides the AP configuration and handles the association and disassociation of devices.\n\n### Important Parameters and Return Values\n\n- `apIndex`: The index of the AP whose maximum associated devices count is to be retrieved. It is an integer value.\n- `output`: A pointer to a variable where the maximum associated devices count will be stored. It is a pointer to an unsigned integer.\n\n### Return Value\n\n- The function returns the following values:\n  - `RETURN_OK` if the operation is successful.\n  - `RETURN_ERR` if any error is detected.\n\n### RDK-Related Operations\n\nThis function is part of the RDK HAL library and is used to manage AP configurations and settings.",
