  "response": "## RDK Function Analysis: `mon_counter_reset`\n\n### 1. Main Purpose and Functionality\n\nThe `mon_counter_reset` function in the OneWifi component of RDK resets the process monitor counters. These counters are used to track various system metrics and monitor the health of the monitored process. Resetting the counters allows for a fresh start when monitoring a new process.\n\n### 2. Key Operations and Data Flow\n\n- The function initializes the `mon_counter_list` variable to NULL. This variable is used to store the shared memory segment where the monitor counter list is stored.\n- It initializes the `mon_sig_forward_pid` variable to 0. This variable stores the process ID (PID) of the child process to which SIGTERM and SIGINT signals will be forwarded.\n\n### 3. Interaction with Other Components\n\n- The function uses the following RDK utilities for signal handling:\n  - `mon_sig_crash`\n  - `mon_sig_forward`\n  - `mon_sig_str`\n- It interacts with the `mon_start` function, which sets up the process monitor and monitors the child process.\n- It interacts with the `mon_check_process` and `mon_check_counter` functions to check the status of the child process and its counters.\n\n### 4. Important Parameters and Return Values\n\n- The function takes no parameters.\n- It has no return value.\n\n### 5. Specific RDK-Related Operations\n\n- The function uses the following RDK-related operations:\n  - `pid_t child = fork();`: Forks the current process, creating a child process.\n  - `task_name_set(new_name);`: Sets the task name of the current process.\n  - `mon_install_child_signals()`: Installs signal handlers for the child process.\n  - `mon_install_parent_signals()`: Installs signal handlers for the parent process.\n  - `mon_reset_parent_signals()`: Resets the signal handlers for the parent process.",
