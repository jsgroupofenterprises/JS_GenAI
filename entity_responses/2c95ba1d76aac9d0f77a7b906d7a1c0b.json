  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `voice_hal_setCCTKTraceLevel` function in the RDK HAL component is used to set the trace level for the CCTK component. CCTK is a core component of the RDK Voice HAL that provides a common interface for voice services to access the underlying hardware and software resources. Setting the trace level allows developers to control the amount of debug information that is generated by the CCTK component.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n* `service`: The voice service that the trace level is being set for.\n* `logLevel`: The trace level to be set.\n\nThe function first validates the input parameters and then sets the trace level for the specified service.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `voice_hal_setCCTKTraceLevel` function interacts with the CCTK component to set the trace level.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* `service`: The voice service that the trace level is being set for.\n* `logLevel`: The trace level to be set.\n* `return value`: The status of the operation.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThe `voice_hal_setCCTKTraceLevel` function is a RDK-specific function that is used to control the trace level of the CCTK component.",
