  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality:**\nThe 'qm_conn_read_res' function is responsible for reading a response from a QM (Qualcomm Mobile Networking) connection. It reads data from a file descriptor 'fd' into a 'qm_response_t' struct 'res' and validates the response.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow:**\n- The function reads data of size 'size' (the size of 'res') from 'fd' into 'res'.\n- If the read operation is successful (ret == size), it checks if the response is valid by calling 'qm_res_valid'. If the response is invalid, it sets the response and error fields of 'res' accordingly.\n- Finally, it returns true if the operation was successful.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any):**\nThis function interacts with the QM library, specifically with the 'qm_res_valid' function.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values:**\n- **Parameters:**\n-- int fd: File descriptor of the QM connection\n-- qm_response_t *res: Pointer to the struct to store the response\n- **Return value:**\n-- bool: True if the operation was successful, false otherwise\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations:**\nThis function is part of the CcspWifiAgent component of RDK, which is responsible for managing Wi-Fi connections. It uses the QM library to communicate with Qualcomm-based Wi-Fi devices.",
