  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n   - The main purpose of this function is to convert an AP index to a corresponding wireless interface name. This function is commonly used within the RDK framework to obtain the correct interface name for communication with a specific wireless access point (AP) or radio.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n   - The function takes three parameters:\n     - `idx`: Index of the AP or radio.\n     - `iface`: Pointer to a character array where the interface name will be stored.\n     - `len`: Length of the character array `iface`.\n   - The function first checks if the `iface` pointer is NULL and returns if it is.\n   - It then initializes the `iface` array to all zeros.\n   - It then checks if the `idx` is less than the number of radios. If it is, it formats the interface name as \"wl`idx`\" (e.g., \"wl0\" for the first radio).\n   - If the `idx` is greater than or equal to the number of radios, it formats the interface name as \"wl`radio_idx`.`ssid_idx`\" (e.g., \"wl0.1\" for the second SSID on the first radio).\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n   - This function does not directly interact with other components.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n   - `idx`: This parameter specifies the index of the AP or radio.\n   - `iface`: This parameter is a pointer to a character array where the interface name is stored.\n   - The function does not return any value.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n   - This function is part of the RDK Centralized Configuration Service (CCS) and is specifically designed for use within the RDK framework. It is used to obtain the correct interface name for communication with a specific wireless AP or radio.",
