  "response": "1. **Main purpose and functionality:**\n   - The `ds_int_cmp` is a comparison function used for sorting integers in ascending order.\n   - It is designed to compare two integers and return a value indicating their relative order.\n\n2. **Key operations and data flow:**\n   - The function takes two void pointers, `_a` and `_b`, and dereferences them to obtain two integers, `a` and `b` respectively.\n   - It then subtracts `b` from `a` to calculate their difference.\n   - If the difference is positive, the function returns a positive value, indicating that `a` is greater than `b`.\n   - If the difference is negative, the function returns a negative value, indicating that `a` is less than `b`.\n   - If the difference is zero, the function returns zero, indicating that `a` is equal to `b`.\n\n3. **Interaction with other components:**\n   - The `ds_int_cmp` function typically interacts with sorting algorithms or data structures that require integer comparison for ordering.\n\n4. **Important parameters and return values:**\n   - `_a` and `_b`: Pointers to the integers being compared.\n   - Return value: An integer indicating the relative order of `a` and `b`. A positive value indicates `a` is greater than `b`, a negative value indicates `a` is less than `b`, and zero indicates `a` is equal to `b`.\n\n5. **Any specific RDK-related operations:**\n    - The provided code does not contain any RDK-specific operations or dependencies.",
