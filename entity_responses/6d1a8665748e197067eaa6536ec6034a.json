  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `wifi_getApIsolationEnable` function enables or disables device isolation on an Access Point (AP). When isolation is enabled, devices connected to the AP are isolated from all other devices within the home network.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes two parameters:\n\n- `apIndex`: The index of the AP to configure.\n- `output`: A pointer to a boolean variable that will be set to true if device isolation is enabled, or false if it is disabled.\n\nThe function first checks to make sure that the apIndex is valid. If it is not, the function returns an error.\n\nIf the apIndex is valid, the function sends a message to the driver to get the current device isolation setting. The driver returns the setting in the output parameter.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe function interacts with the following components:\n\n- The Wi-Fi driver\n- The Access Point\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following parameters are important:\n\n- `apIndex`: The index of the AP to configure.\n- `output`: A pointer to a boolean variable that will be set to true if device isolation is enabled, or false if it is disabled.\n\nThe function returns the following values:\n\n- `RETURN_OK` if the operation was successful.\n- `RETURN_ERR` if the operation failed.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThis function is specific to RDK. It is not available in other operating systems.",
