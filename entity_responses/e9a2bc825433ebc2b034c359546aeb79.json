  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\nThe ovsdb_table_filter_row() function is used to filter a row of data from an OVSDB table based on a set of columns. The function takes a row of data and an array of columns as input, and returns a filtered row of data. The filter operation can be either '+' (include) or '-' (exclude), and the columns specified in the array are used to determine which data to include or exclude from the filtered row.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\nThe function first checks if the row and columns arguments are valid. If either argument is invalid, the function returns the original row unmodified. The function then counts the number of columns in the array and checks if it is empty. If the array is empty, the function returns the original row unmodified.\n\nThe function then checks the first column in the array to determine the filter operation. If the first column is '+', the function calls the ovsdb_row_filter_argv() function to include the specified columns in the filtered row. If the first column is '-', the function calls the ovsdb_row_filtout_argv() function to exclude the specified columns from the filtered row.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\nThe ovsdb_table_filter_row() function interacts with the OVSDB table manager to retrieve and filter the data in an OVSDB table. The function uses the ovsdb_row_filter_argv() and ovsdb_row_filtout_argv() functions to perform the actual filtering of the data.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* **row:** The row of data to be filtered.\n* **columns:** An array of columns to include or exclude from the filtered row.\n* **Return value:** The filtered row of data.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\nThe ovsdb_table_filter_row() function is used in the RDK to filter data from OVSDB tables. The function is used in the CcspWifiAgent component to filter data from the Wifi table.",
