  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `platform_hal_GetTotalMemorySize` function returns the total DRAM memory size available in the device.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe function takes a reference to a `ULONG` variable as its only parameter. It populates this variable with the total memory size in bytes.\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe function does not directly interact with any other components, but the value it returns is likely used by other components to determine how much memory is available for use.\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\n* `pulSize`: A reference to a `ULONG` variable that will be populated with the total memory size in bytes.\n* Return value: The function returns `RETURN_OK` if successful, or `RETURN_ERR` if an error occurs.\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\n\nThis function is part of the RDK HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) and is used to provide a consistent way to access hardware features across different devices.",
