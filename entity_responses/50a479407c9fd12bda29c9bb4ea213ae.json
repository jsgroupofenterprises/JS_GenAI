Main purpose and functionality\n   \n   >The `wifi_getFTOverDSActivated` function in the `hal` component of RDK gets the Fast Transition over DS activated value. Fast Transition (FT) is a mechanism that allows a wireless client to quickly and securely roam between access points (APs) in a wireless network. FT uses a technique called pre-authentication to establish a secure connection with a new AP before the client disconnects from the current AP. This allows the client to seamlessly roam to the new AP without having to go through the full authentication process again.\n\n   FT over DS (Distribution System) is a variant of FT that allows the client to use its existing connection to the distribution system to establish a connection with the new AP. This can be useful in environments where the APs are connected to a common distribution system, such as a cable modem or fiber optic network.\n   \n### 2. Key operations and data flow\n\n    - The function takes two parameters:\n        - `apIndex`: The index of the AP for which to get the FT over DS activated value.\n        - `activate`: A pointer to a boolean variable that will be set to `true` if FT over DS is activated for the specified AP, or `false` if it is not.\n    - The function first checks if the specified AP index is valid. If the index is invalid, the function returns `RETURN_ERR`.\n    - If the index is valid, the function gets the FT over DS activated value from the HAL and stores it in the `activate` parameter.\n    - The function then returns `RETURN_OK`.\n\n### 3. Interaction with other components (if any)\n\n    - The `wifi_getFTOverDSActivated` function interacts with the HAL to get the FT over DS activated value for the specified AP.\n\n### 4. Important parameters and return values\n\n    - `apIndex`: The index of the AP for which to get the FT over DS activated value.\n    - `activate`: A pointer to a boolean variable that will be set to `true` if FT over DS is activated for the specified AP, or `false` if it is not.\n\n### 5. Any specific RDK-related operations\n\n    - The `wifi_getFTOverDSActivated` function is part of the RDK HAL API, which is a set of functions that provide a common interface to the HAL for different RDK components.",
