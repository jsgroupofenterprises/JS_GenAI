  "response": "**1. Main purpose and functionality**\n\nThe `INT(* wifi_newApAssociatedDevice_callback)(INT apIndex, wifi_associated_dev3_t *associated_dev)` function \nis a callback function that is used to register a function to be called when a new device is associated with an access point.\n\n**2. Key operations and data flow**\n\nThe following diagram shows the key operations and data flow of the function:\nUser calls register_wifi_newApAssociatedDevice_callback() to register a callback function to be called when a new device is associated with an access point.\nWhen a new device is associated with the access point, the registered callback function is called.\nThe callback function is passed the index of the access point and a pointer to a structure containing information about the associated device.\n\n\n**3. Interaction with other components (if any)**\n\nThe `INT(* wifi_newApAssociatedDevice_callback)(INT apIndex, wifi_associated_dev3_t *associated_dev)` function interacts with the following components:\n- The WiFi access point driver\n- The WiFi management daemon\n- The RDK logger\n\n\n**4. Important parameters and return values**\n\nThe following are the important parameters and return values of the `INT(* wifi_newApAssociatedDevice_callback)(INT apIndex, wifi_associated_dev3_t *associated_dev)` function:\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\n|--|--|--|\n| apIndex | INT | The index of the access point. |\n| associated_dev | wifi_associated_dev3_t * | A pointer to a structure containing information about the associated device. |\n|  |  |  |\n\n\n\n**5. Any specific RDK-related operations**\nThe `INT(* wifi_newApAssociatedDevice_callback)(INT apIndex, wifi_associated_dev3_t *associated_dev)` function is an RDK-specific function. It is used to register a callback function to be called when a new device is associated with an access point.",
